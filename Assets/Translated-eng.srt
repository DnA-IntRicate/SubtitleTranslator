1
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,833
You will not escape my curse!

2
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,068
God help me!

3
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:13,959
Alps! Wait for me to hear from paper clip jugs!

4
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,754
Alps retreat!

5
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,887
Don't leave anyone alive!

6
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:29,042
Oh right!

7
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,705
The fate of all of you will be worse!

8
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:04,308
We've destroyed their headquarters, Olof, we have to go.

9
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:10,493
This is just the beginning, they will pay for every blood they shed.

10
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:16,329
We'll make it pay, Olof. We'll pay together, but not now... Not now.

11
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,297
We're pulling back!

12
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,142
What headquarters is this Osman Bey!

13
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:45,471
From whom did you get permission and you set up headquarters!

14
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,272
by God!

15
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,583
I don't get permission from anyone for gas in the way of truth.

16
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,828
If you don't know me, ask the person next to you.

17
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,469
He knows me well.

18
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,332
You're being unfair, Osman Bey.

19
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,332
I give you full credit.

20
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:23,063
Hunter, reach the headquarters with our soldiers.

21
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:29,061
May you come to the rescue of those who are broken for the sake of a dreamer.

22
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:31,869
No...

23
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:38,187
We don't need anyone's help

24
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,726
You break the peace between the two states!

25
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,254
You go and raid them!

26
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,947
You will pay for them!

27
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:56,462
We pay whatever the price is, wherever you want, whenever you want.

28
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,587
Mr. Turgut!

29
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:27,583
You stay.

30
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:40,455
He's leaving, my sultan, won't he catch up?

31
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:46,441
It only arrives in the morning, when everyone perish.

32
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,753
You see, right?

33
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,221
What, His Excellency, Sultan?

34
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:00,000
Osman's arrogance!

35
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:04,253
Kibri will defeat Osman!

36
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,253
Choose your rank now!

37
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,110
Are you with Osman or with me?

38
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,006
No, nowhere, no news from the alps at the door.

39
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:58,107
He left Yenişehir in the morning and never came back.

40
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,104
Something has definitely happened to them!

41
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,768
Open your mouth for good, Ayşe Hatun.

42
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:06,423
Shouldn't they have fled to Oba?

43
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:10,150
No Ülgen, her daughter ran away, would Bengi ever sit idle?

44
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:12,412
By now he had raided our mansion.

45
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:20,001
Aha, look at yours there.

46
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:27,589
They told me to prepare the stick at the moment.

47
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,516
Does the girl whose daughter ran away ever come to the market?

48
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:37,303
There is a business in this business... There is a business in this business.

49
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,416
If you have a heart, come to me.

50
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,001
Who are you and what are you? I will find you, I will find you!

51
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,644
Get in front of me, you coward!

52
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,961
Subasi is just yours.

53
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,283
You get your water out.

54
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,140
Don't think about it.

55
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,665
Good, let's go to Yenişehir too.

56
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:53,794
Those who can't see us may be suspicious.

57
00:10:54,923 --> 00:11:02,105
Well, my newly engaged man, let's go and stand at our counter.

58
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:16,988
Couldn't they escape!

59
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:26,629
Wow what happened to us!
- Well, if Alçiçek is here...

60
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,150
Where is Aktemur?

61
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:45,000
Ülgen, let's check this girl's mouth.

62
00:11:56,663 --> 00:12:00,000
Ayşe Hatun, Ülgen Hatun.

63
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,195
What do you want from me?

64
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,501
Mr. Alçiçek Aktemur-
- My mother is coming!

65
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,805
Don't let him see you.

66
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:16,411
You should not mention that name to me again. That matter is over!

67
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,803
What do you say, Alçiçek?

68
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:26,590
I will marry Bayındır. You stay away from me.

69
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:35,955
Walk...

70
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:45,396
I don't understand anything, what's going on?

71
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:49,722
What will happen, it is obvious that he has returned from the Alçiçek road.

72
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,988
Ah Aktemur ah!

73
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,922
I went on a road

74
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,719
Or?
- I'm going to kidnap Alçiçek.

75
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,247
Did you say to run away?
- He said.

76
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,715
While leaving the fort.

77
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:12,691
She is angry with heart... If she loves you enough to leave her mother and father behind.

78
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,186
Don't worry, go do what you have to, I'm behind you.

79
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:32,952
Then I won't make you wait, the crooked trees in the pine grove wait for me there.

80
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,407
Good luck, Aktemur, be cautious.

81
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:48,054
There is no Sister Aktemur, you should inform Malhun soon.

82
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:51,183
Let's go where Aktemur said

83
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:55,442
Alps! Get the horses ready and we'll go.

84
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:59,169
I will come with you, I will not leave you alone.

85
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,501
Come on, Ulgen, come on.

86
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,518
Alps!

87
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,567
We will bury our martyrs, who will set off soon, in Yenişehir.

88
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,218
Osman Bey is coming!

89
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:26,721
Catapults.

90
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:36,361
There's a lot of work in these...

91
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:49,921
There is good work.

92
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,601
are you okay?
- I am good.

93
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:14,548
honey...

94
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:23,723
honey.

95
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:30,839
honey.

96
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:37,091
My Bala is my valiant girl.

97
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:43,210
are you okay?
- I'm fine Osman, but...

98
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,592
They burned down everywhere.

99
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:56,711
All around... the Alps...

100
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,695
You didn't trust your brain, is that it?

101
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:20,017
Come here... Come here! When we turn our backs, they raid the headquarters.

102
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,471
Now get out of my way!

103
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,201
I've been standing behind you for all these years.

104
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,953
But your anger has blinded you, Osman Bey!

105
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,614
At the very first mistake, you hit it and you lose it.

106
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,198
Turgut Bey was right.
- Fall down!

107
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:07,496
Storm.

108
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,489
Call the gentlemen, I'll collect the sofa

109
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,220
The command is my lord.

110
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:22,966
They broke our arm but we can't stop

111
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,859
Now they're going to want to hit us on the head.

112
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,188
Orhan!
- Sir.

113
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:34,975
Arrive in Karacahisar with your brother and lure all the gentlemen.

114
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:39,433
You will take them all and come to Yenişehir.
- It's your command, sir.

115
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:42,828
honey.

116
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,469
You go with the alps.

117
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,757
I'm going to drop by someone and come over.

118
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,116
Thank you sir.

119
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,305
Come on alps.

120
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,601
Oh braves...

121
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:28,634
O Allah, grant us to take revenge on the oppressors and traitors, amen.

122
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:44,454
Prosper and send word to Olof. Let them come to listen to my new orders.

123
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,244
I'm going to have more to do with Olof than I thought.

124
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,905
Are you really going to give Marmaracik to Olof, my sultan?

125
00:19:54,905 --> 00:20:00,493
That fool thinks so, but I'm not going to give a piece of land.

126
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:06,413
When I'm done with Osman, I'm done with Olof.

127
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,630
What will your next move be for Osman, sir?

128
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:18,331
I will create a great hell for Osman, the hell of loneliness.

129
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:27,573
His friends, people and even his family will not stand by him.

130
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:42,993
I will blow the wind of absence in Yenişehir.

131
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:49,497
The people of Osman's brain will starve.

132
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:52,699
They will fall for me.

133
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:56,982
They will turn their back on Osman.

134
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:04,093
Those who turn their backs on Osman will be with me.

135
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:11,607
Valide sultans will take care of the whole Yenişehir.

136
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Count the warehouses, too, so that no gaps are left.

137
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:51,983
We have entered a path, but may God bless our end.

138
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:53,916
Amen sir, amen.

139
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:08,061
This intruder... Now you raid our property?

140
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,729
Cut!

141
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:18,168
Get out.

142
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:33,595
You put our case halfway through.

143
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,319
They killed our Alps.

144
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,784
Only you knew where the headquarters was.

145
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:50,697
You put us in the middle of nowhere.

146
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:57,879
And now, should I know this from you?

147
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,404
You told me that as if you didn't even know it.

148
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:06,397
Even if our paths are one, let's not cross each other, Osman Bey.

149
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:11,785
Our path is not the same when one becomes a servant to the Sultan.

150
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,775
You don't know what you said and now you accuse him of treason?

151
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,905
You're completely blind-
- I'm not rolling my eyes!

152
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:28,483
I know you haven't shrunk enough to say headquarters.

153
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,406
But you're small enough to turn around.

154
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,861
They dared and attacked because it wasn't you.

155
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:42,618
I leaned on you, I knew you as a mountain.

156
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:47,741
But you, you weren't even a hill.

157
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,598
You hurt me the most.

158
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,923
What did you do to me?

159
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:04,090
I'm not a blunt knife, Osman, if you sharpen that much, I'll cut it too, of course.

160
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:09,611
I said to the one who sharpened himself against me for a property!

161
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:14,616
Let this be a lesson to me.

162
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,745
do you know what you did?

163
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:23,623
You changed what you set out with what you found on the way.

164
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,948
Do you know how many losses I have when I walk behind you?

165
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:31,476
How many wounds are on my body, how many precious things have I lost in my hand!

166
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:40,252
Few of my followers are alive.

167
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:44,378
I buried my woman with her baby in her womb, Osman Bey!

168
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,375
I buried my brothers and sisters!

169
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:54,225
Have we given these losses to return from the road for a fortress?

170
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:55,223
Fortress...

171
00:24:56,751 --> 00:25:00,678
If the case does not reach its goal, then all the losses are in vain!

172
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:02,346
You still say citadel.

173
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:08,265
What fortress? Can't you see I'm the ruler of Inegol.

174
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,384
The issue is different.

175
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,183
Osman... Now walk and see if you can walk to Köprühisar...

176
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:40,774
Osman, this move must have driven him crazy, Olof.

177
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:44,036
We broke Osman's feet.

178
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:49,690
Soon, very soon, I will break his neck as well.

179
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,421
Ismihan became what the sultan wanted.

180
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:56,614
I think he was satisfied.
- And ours?

181
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,932
Will it be what we want too?

182
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,663
Marmaracik is ours now.

183
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,825
My brother Frodi is right. What if Ismihan Sultan does not give Marmaracik to us?

184
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,356
olof.

185
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:30,000
Ismihan sultan wants to meet you.

186
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:38,179
Is it different...

187
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:41,249
Other...

188
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:45,708
The issue is different.

189
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:54,152
You want more, you are not satisfied with what you have.

190
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,946
Your heart is full of greed for property.

191
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:02,310
Look at you, look at this arrogance!

192
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:08,828
You put me in this situation, are you going to complain about Turgut that you have turned into now?

193
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,293
Have you forgotten the injustice you have done, Osman Bey?

194
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:16,349
Of course I will give the castle to Öktem! Certainly...

195
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:23,339
They will leave if I do not give them property.

196
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,003
They pull away.

197
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,920
But you, you were my pillar.

198
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,654
I knew you differently.

199
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:40,647
But...

200
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:44,641
for a property

201
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,964
I never knew you would switch sides.

202
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,485
I do not change sides for neither property nor property.

203
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,467
Make your final decision.

204
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:07,324
Choose your side.

205
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:14,506
You are not what I swear.

206
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,695
Get out of the pen now, Osman Bey.

207
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:26,080
Inegol...
- Inegol.

208
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:32,465
it is not yours.

209
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,623
This is not bloodless...

210
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,211
I always fought, I always took the lead.

211
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:56,736
I endured the fitna, but...

212
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:02,688
but those behind me have always fallen for these tricks.

213
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:06,232
I always fought.

214
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:13,102
Now you too will fight... Against me.

215
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:21,015
Two days, you will leave this place!

216
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:27,200
We will give our lives

217
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:31,658
but if you want our homeland

218
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:34,853
We don't give, Osman...

219
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,297
Then I'll take both!

220
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,959
There are horse marks on both sides.

221
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,949
Sisters! Open your eyes!

222
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,476
Let's not put a place we didn't look!

223
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:25,598
We will turn every place upside down, Ayşe Hatun, may your heart be at ease.

224
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,469
We will find a trace.

225
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:33,698
There is no returning to Yenişehir without finding a trace!

226
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:02,504
Where are you son?

227
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,235
Where are you?

228
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,225
What is this?

229
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,690
Ulgen...
- These earrings

230
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:17,445
Don't you have Alçiçek?

231
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:22,834
Well if it came here... I'm totally confused

232
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Did you understand anything from this?

233
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:29,558
I don't know Ulgen, I don't know.

234
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:36,541
All I know is that Alçiçek has eaten my son's head.

235
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:39,072
Seven.

236
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:41,670
Ayse Hatun.

237
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,467
Say!

238
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,135
This is the horse of my lord Aktemur

239
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:50,441
My God, protect me, O Lord!

240
00:31:58,582 --> 00:31:59,718
Aktemur.

241
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,780
Aktemur.

242
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:06,774
Call...

243
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:12,494
Search everywhere! Find and search!

244
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,909
Find my ulgen son.

245
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:17,842
We will find it.

246
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:26,486
Ah!

247
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,283
My daughter...

248
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:34,006
What is this madness?

249
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:40,863
Are you thinking of Aktemur again?

250
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:45,852
No, why should I think about the man who left me behind, mother?

251
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,051
I think about what I will do.

252
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:54,568
Good for you to listen to your mother.

253
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:59,359
That boy has no heart to run away.

254
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:03,684
His love was a lie, my daughter.

255
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,928
You listen to your mother, don't worry about the rest, emi?

256
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:24,844
I've had my share, mother.

257
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,173
Other than that, whatever you say.

258
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:38,580
At that time, I say, let's not delay this naive thing, let's do it right away.

259
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:06,186
Sir, what is this situation, are you going to the sofa?

260
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:10,711
What if we go to the sofa

261
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know how to look at Osman Bey's face.

262
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,056
You didn't do anything wrong, a thousand people want a girl, one person gets it.

263
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:24,049
There is nothing to be offended about in that.

264
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,713
That's right.

265
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:32,832
But we didn't do well, we turned Osman Bey out of the door.

266
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:39,350
What would we do when there is a huge Ismihan sultan?
Were we going to listen to Osman Bey?

267
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:46,067
You did the right thing, and behind you is Ismihan Sultan.

268
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:53,183
Alflower is she alright?

269
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,781
Is there consent?

270
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,768
I talked to him and he has consent to marry Bayındır.

271
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,880
Good, Aybars...

272
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,681
Let's go so we don't be late.

273
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:38,682
You will wait, gentlemen.

274
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:40,416
What would we wait for?

275
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,735
Are we not allowed on the other sofa?

276
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,618
What could be the reason for the Alps?

277
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,478
Osman Bey sees it as unsuitable.

278
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,992
If there is a problem, the Alps will accompany you until the Yenişehir gate.

279
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,468
Selamun aleykum.
- Aleykumselam.

280
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:28,790
Gentlemen, our wedding was a divan.

281
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:32,517
Of course this will come at a cost.

282
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:38,304
The cost of this was also a decrease.

283
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:44,601
Our path is more arduous than before.

284
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,867
But the conquests will continue.

285
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:50,197
We will continue to march on the enemy.

286
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:53,234
We will never bow to the oppressors.

287
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:58,423
But if anyone wants to cross the threshold of the sofa

288
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:02,848
he will know the greasy rope around his neck.

289
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:09,908
on the sofa without putting his head under his arm.
No one will attempt to cross the threshold!

290
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:15,000
This is my last warning, this is the last chance for anyone who wants to return.

291
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
No reason will be asked of those who want to go.

292
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,785
But if anyone wants to come, our door is always open.

293
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:33,189
He who does not risk death will not walk on this road! Come on guys!

294
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:46,218
Osman Bey gave salut, why do you stand?

295
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:48,949
He also warned us

296
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:55,398
He said, 'Hey, the one who turns from the road will lose both his highness and his principality.

297
00:38:55,797 --> 00:39:02,249
Alp, a person who is not a gentleman has no right to carry a pusat.

298
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,382
Give!

299
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:18,009
There was to smash it with my embers...

300
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:29,551
Here you are.

301
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:47,496
that holds us responsible for the expedition, not the victory
I open the divan in the ninety-nine names of Almighty Allah.

302
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,628
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

303
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:51,894
"Bismillahirrahmanirrahim."

304
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:57,991
Of course, you heard what happened to our headquarters in preparation for the conquest.

305
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:00,855
We heard the black news, Osman Bey.

306
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,988
But that's not what you needed to hear!

307
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,623
All you needed to hear was the rumor of conquest.

308
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:15,844
Sir, you keep your conquests a secret...

309
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,432
Who is the one who demolished the headquarters?

310
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:28,415
I'll take his head when I find out.

311
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:32,608
Who is the attacker?

312
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:36,801
The attacker is Olof.

313
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:47,504
No attack, no betrayal, is strong enough to stop us.

314
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,766
That's why I assembled the sofa.

315
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:54,826
We will put everything that was burned in its place as soon as possible.

316
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:56,789
We are ready to do whatever it takes, sir.

317
00:40:58,118 --> 00:41:00,517
Blood, blood, life.

318
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:03,647
Thank you, thank you.

319
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:09,367
What would Osman Bey Ismihan Sultan say about this situation?

320
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,619
You were going to give me land, my sultan.

321
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:35,133
How many years ago did your ancestors come to Constantinople?

322
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,923
Two centuries?

323
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,630
three centuries?

324
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:53,918
Despite all these years of service, the land that Rome did not give

325
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:59,266
What makes you think you can take it from me so easily?

326
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:06,647
That's not the point, I did what you said, now it's your turn, sultan.

327
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:13,563
You will give me the land you promised, the Marmaracik fortress!

328
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:15,430
Here too!

329
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:25,071
Lord Olof, are you so keen on dying?

330
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,948
I will keep my promise...

331
00:42:42,948 --> 00:42:48,337
you are who i am! You will not forget, Commander Olof!

332
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,533
Do not...

333
00:42:56,057 --> 00:43:00,914
If I give you a piece of land now, Osman will take it back immediately.

334
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:06,568
Good thing he tries, I'll crush him under those walls.

335
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:12,421
Not your own desires! You will do what I want...

336
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,063
First, Osman will disappear.

337
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:30,494
When Osman gets the news, he goes out to look for his nephew Aktemur.

338
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,152
And you're going to lure him into the biggest trap.

339
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:40,872
To the death trap.
- Don't worry, sultan.

340
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:44,621
I've already prepared my move.

341
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,129
My Sultan Turgut Bey is coming.

342
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:28,236
Anyone who is curious about Ismihan Sultan's opinion should follow him.

343
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:35,086
Why did you cross the threshold, Mr. Şahin?

344
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:39,411
I ask simply to understand the situation we will take.

345
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:45,000
If you have any doubt, the oily rope is on our neck, Osman Bey.

346
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,182
Thanks...

347
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:55,493
Otherwise...

348
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:04,241
What is spoken on the sofa stays on the other sofa.

349
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:17,469
The conquest of Köprühisar was over.

350
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:20,399
All the preparations were destroyed!

351
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,262
But...

352
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
Now is the time to conquer

353
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,063
They will not anticipate that we will be ready in a short time.

354
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:40,644
Let them know about Köprühisar.
They won't even be able to imagine that we're walking.

355
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,644
Alps.
- Sir.

356
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,560
You will cut down trees even in the dark of night.

357
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:52,417
You will continue to build the catapults by torchlight.

358
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:55,347
It will be prepared from the Alps thesis.

359
00:45:55,945 --> 00:45:59,708
Blacksmiths will continue to beat the pusats without blinking an eye.

360
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:02,904
And you will bring the war equipment.

361
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,691
They cut off our beard, we will cut off their heads.

362
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:12,286
I hope soon, sir.

363
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:17,674
The other divan is finished, you should make your preparations from your thesis.

364
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:22,996
The pusats you will bring will be the key to the conquest.

365
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,557
Mr. Osman!

366
00:46:39,082 --> 00:46:40,218
Aktemur...

367
00:46:41,148 --> 00:46:43,371
What happened to Aktemur?
- It's not there, sir!

368
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:48,029
My Bey went to kidnap Alçiçek, and never came back.

369
00:46:48,494 --> 00:46:53,417
I went to the place he promised, he has a horse, but he does not.

370
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:58,302
Osman, I have no children!

371
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:04,635
What do you say, Ayşe lady? Why would you do such a thing without asking me?

372
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:14,541
Boran, send the Cerkutays to the place where the thesis Ayşe is talking about.

373
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,402
Let him start looking for traces.

374
00:47:17,465 --> 00:47:21,259
Let the Alps get ready, our range will be elsewhere.

375
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:23,785
The command is my lord.

376
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,541
Her Majesty the Valide Sultan.

377
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:47,384
Then, my Valide Sultan, I will immediately start the preparations for the wedding.

378
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:53,304
Start, of course, start so that you can walk the path.

379
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,832
Walk so that you can reach vusla, Bayindir.

380
00:47:57,364 --> 00:47:58,899
Heads up, my Valide Sultan.

381
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:15,662
Yes, Mr. Turgut, what brought you here without even informing?

382
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,715
He did not choose the right one that I said Gardaş.

383
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:26,246
On the contrary, he wants İnegöl under my control.

384
00:48:26,977 --> 00:48:33,295
I'm here, Mr. Turgut! Osman does not rule where I am!

385
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:40,943
Does he want all his property to be taken with a single edict?

386
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,740
What does this Osman Bey want?

387
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:47,068
Arrogance...

388
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,859
Unfortunately, there was truth in what you said.

389
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:55,695
Arrogance Osman has blinded the brain.

390
00:48:56,758 --> 00:49:00,490
Whatever he wants, he wants from him.

391
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:05,347
He took us behind him and lined you up before him.

392
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:08,277
He made many conquests.

393
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:12,980
Now he wants to be sentenced with cruelty.

394
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,922
Didn't you shed blood for İnegöl, Mr. Turgut?

395
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,048
You shed your sentence like great gentlemen.

396
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:25,643
You even dared to turn your back on us.

397
00:49:27,038 --> 00:49:32,607
Osman fought the so-called oppression, and now he is one of the oppressors.

398
00:49:36,328 --> 00:49:43,178
While I am here, it is forbidden to persecute them, Turgut Bey.

399
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:06,014
If you take my side, you will be provided with as many soldiers and commuters as you wish.

400
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:13,315
You will always feel the presence of the Valide Sultan behind you.

401
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,588
I didn't believe what you said before but I saw it with my own eyes

402
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,893
I have no place in those who have no loyalty to me.

403
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,313
I'm naive...

404
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:43,568
Valide Sultan is with you.

405
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:35,396
Osman will fall into our hands when he thinks he has come to you.

406
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:44,239
Your turn will come too.

407
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,329
But first I'm going to kill your uncle.

408
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:54,781
And when I get what I want, I will give your blood to Odin.

409
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,977
You will not reach your goal, dog breed!

410
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,583
Did you throw the bait?
- And how...

411
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:29,230
First we made it even harder for them to find traces that would confuse them so they wouldn't suspect.

412
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,582
But all traces will lead them to the same place.

413
00:52:34,512 --> 00:52:35,980
Osman's tomb.

414
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,000
Today we will fight like it is our last day!

415
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:48,784
We will kill Osman and those around him!

416
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:52,910
Stay on top of it.

417
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:58,431
Don't worry, I'll continue to be very nice to him.

418
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:07,015
Let your axes be your sharp Odin companion! Let's go!

419
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:29,536
very nice Martha

420
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:33,330
Send me a ball of each of these.

421
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:38,187
Of course, Bengi Hatun, when you look at the fabrics you have chosen

422
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:40,918
It is clear that you understand from the fabric.

423
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:47,921
Bengi Hatun knows the best of everything.

424
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:58,491
Oh dear, it means the wrong done to her has been done to us.

425
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,887
Let him give the best of everything he chooses.

426
00:54:03,614 --> 00:54:05,614
Welcome, Mr. Bayindir.

427
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:08,013
Certainly.

428
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,803
Good to meet you, Mr. Bayındır, I would call you too.

429
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:15,000
No need to delay the wedding.

430
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:19,259
Let your mouth eat honey, Bengi lady.

431
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:23,385
I will come after our Valide Sultan.

432
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,710
We say let's have the wedding tomorrow.

433
00:54:33,822 --> 00:54:36,951
While the litter is gone

434
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:40,951
must not delay.

435
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:46,274
The way of reason is, I will talk to Mr. Öktem and you can start your preparations.

436
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,340
Hussein!
- Sir.

437
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:53,661
We have a bridal shower tomorrow.

438
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,058
It's your command, sir.

439
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,986
Speaking of trash, I couldn't see you around. What did you do to Aktemur?

440
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:15,826
I didn't do anything but...

441
00:55:16,756 --> 00:55:23,274
Obviously, someone acted before me and removed the trash in the middle.

442
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:26,603
Well, I didn't get my hands dirty for nothing.

443
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:31,194
What can I say, I am a beloved servant of Allah.

444
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:38,842
Hatun, you can write whatever Bengi chick chooses on my account.

445
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:43,101
He doesn't! We see our own business.

446
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:48,689
Just do your part.... Groom!

447
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:50,260
What would you do?

448
00:56:52,718 --> 00:56:56,910
What do you smell, do you think it's food, let the smell come.

449
00:56:57,907 --> 00:57:00,837
Not every trace you left behind, Gürbüz alp.

450
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:04,240
Some traces are not visible.

451
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:08,299
Can this be a job! Are you playing games with me!

452
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,166
Osman Bey also gave me this meczubu!

453
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:20,963
Coming... Coming!

454
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:32,960
So, you have other skills besides eating food.

455
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:37,153
If you only knew what other talents I have.

456
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:42,940
Selamunaleykum guards
- Aleykumselam.

457
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:46,934
Nothing came of the traces that went since Cerkutay Alp.

458
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:57,571
It means we are on the right track.

459
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,365
All traces point to the devotees.

460
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:04,893
You continue along this road...

461
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,729
I'll go and tell my boss.

462
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,289
Look at me! Give me that apple!

463
00:58:21,947 --> 00:58:27,243
Come here give that apple! Give me my apple! I'll burn you, I'll burn you!

464
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,236
Gurbuz, come on.

465
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:38,617
Anyway, I'll find you.

466
00:58:41,673 --> 00:58:45,268
One of Osman's brains, Konur would like to see you.

467
00:58:48,723 --> 00:58:49,660
Let it come.

468
00:59:10,286 --> 00:59:16,206
What is the reason for you to come before us, bent like this, Osman's alp?

469
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:20,199
It is waking up from the sleep of years of heedlessness, my sultan.

470
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:24,581
I am not Osman's alp.

471
00:59:26,175 --> 00:59:27,924
I was a skillful commander of Ulu Selçuk.

472
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:30,000
So now?

473
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:33,927
Now I am a man fired by sentence labor.

474
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:39,137
We're not going to accept everyone who's been fired.

475
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,337
Who wants you to accept my sultan

476
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:46,592
I came here to ask forgiveness from my state and then to see what I deserve.

477
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:52,512
What is the treatment he deserves, Mr. Hunter?

478
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:56,771
Take all you have forty falakas.
- False.

479
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:03,045
While I was affiliated with the state, I went after a master and betrayed my office.

480
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:08,042
What I deserve is execution.
- He...

481
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,685
You came here to kill you, right?

482
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,818
It is.

483
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:43,408
The price of betrayal can only be paid with life.

484
01:00:54,177 --> 01:00:55,446
But you

485
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:00,000
You will pay with the service.

486
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:01,862
I will do whatever you want, my sultan.

487
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,393
You will already

488
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:06,725
What is my duty?

489
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:26,891
They will think that you destroyed us.

490
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:32,147
But we will not stumble, the conquest will continue.

491
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:37,210
As the cause of God makes our hearts tremble

492
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:40,871
we will continue to shake the world.

493
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,598
Don't fall for yogis!

494
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,049
Our goal is clear.

495
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,553
Our target is Köprühisar.

496
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:11,526
Our current headquarters is very close to Marmaracık.

497
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:14,390
Is it for action?

498
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,051
This place will make our conquest easier.

499
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:24,111
It is both hidden and overt.

500
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:28,968
If we are this close to Marmaracık, will we inform Öktem Bey?

501
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,126
Let's complete a headquarters, then we will release it if necessary.

502
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:35,196
Thank you sir.

503
01:02:35,661 --> 01:02:39,588
We said that we would say on the sofa that he already makes his preparations!

504
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,784
We have no secrets from anyone.

505
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:47,487
When the catapults are ready, we will hit even harder than before!

506
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:50,284
I hope sir.
- I hope so, sir.

507
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,879
Sir, what about Aktemur?

508
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:58,344
Aktemur...
- Sir!

509
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,344
Cerkutay

510
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:06,373
We found Aktemur brain trace, they keep it in the ascetics.

511
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:07,718
Are you sure?

512
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:11,445
Traces are tricky, sir, but they all show Pious.

513
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:21,983
Alps get ready, we'll go get Aktemur.

514
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:03,498
The face of a child of mine did not smile.

515
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:08,953
O Lord, forgive my son, O Lord.

516
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:10,289
Amine.

517
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:15,611
My Ayşe, you will meet your son with the permission of Allah.

518
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:17,611
You don't.

519
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:22,668
Oh, Osman Bey will not put Aktemur in the hands of those rascals.

520
01:04:22,668 --> 01:04:24,500
They're sure to come.

521
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:26,699
They will come.

522
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,171
Thanks.

523
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:40,287
Don't say you didn't hear

524
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:48,531
Tomorrow evening at Marmaracik Fortress with Bayındır Bey
Öktem's daughter, Alçiçek, is born.

525
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:50,770
Sentence Yenişehir is invited.

526
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:55,560
Don't, Lowflower!

527
01:04:56,424 --> 01:05:01,945
He burned my daughter's head.

528
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:04,203
My Ayşe, calm down.

529
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:21,631
You're all here huh babes.

530
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:25,292
I also came for good news.

531
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,023
But obviously...

532
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:34,341
you got the news.
- We got it, Bengi lady.

533
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,806
We got it, good luck!

534
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:41,373
I hope you, as a mother, will not regret this decision.

535
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:49,286
May God not make him regret it, of course, but I don't see anything to regret.

536
01:05:57,133 --> 01:06:00,595
Or are you offended because we didn't give Alçiçek to you?

537
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:04,256
Bengi chick, whatever you want to say

538
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:06,692
Do not keep us busy for nothing.

539
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:12,559
I understand that you are offended, but don't be offended, babes.

540
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:18,147
If my Alçiçek is beautiful, is it a crime if there are many people who want it?

541
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:27,057
A thousand people want a girl, one person takes it.

542
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Isn't that right, Ayşe Hatun?

543
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:41,375
Is Aktemur also invisible, ashamed and unable to go out on the street?

544
01:06:45,295 --> 01:06:48,159
Bengi Hatun is Aktemur Subaşı.

545
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:53,349
He does not even have time to scratch his head, he is on duty.

546
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:58,538
You should not worry about my boy, if not today, he will forget tomorrow.

547
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,468
Of course he forgets.

548
01:07:03,468 --> 01:07:04,936
Have to forget.

549
01:07:11,514 --> 01:07:15,997
Anyway, please convey my regards to Osman.

550
01:07:18,728 --> 01:07:20,529
We are waiting for you all at our wedding.

551
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:28,735
My Ayşe!

552
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:33,393
My Ayşe, let me love your eyes, calm down.

553
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,785
He's here to show off.

554
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:41,778
Let me find a child

555
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:46,502
I know I will tell you wait for me.

556
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:53,684
I'll hold back now, but I'll hold back hard.

557
01:07:54,348 --> 01:08:00,666
But when that day comes, do not stand in front of me!

558
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:48,314
Sir, there are soldiers guarding all around.

559
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:51,443
There are too many of them, sir.

560
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:54,771
We will water our other pusats with the blood of kufr.

561
01:08:57,096 --> 01:08:58,764
We found their lair.

562
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Now we're going to cut off their heads.

563
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:07,122
Come on God! God is right!

564
01:09:07,122 --> 01:09:08,590
Attack! Kill them all!

565
01:10:44,354 --> 01:10:45,818
Come on, come on...

566
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,884
You're looking for your niece, right?

567
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:49,607
I get what I'm looking for!

568
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:54,597
All you get today is Aktemur's corpse!

569
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,594
You won't be able to see him either.

570
01:10:57,594 --> 01:11:00,657
I will take Aktemur and I will take your life too!

571
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:02,342
Attack!

572
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,541
Come on now! Come!

573
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:15,421
Cerkutay!

574
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:00,557
Baysungur.

575
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:17,857
Osman!

576
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:21,478
I came to kill you!

577
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:25,205
I'm here too, so as not to spill the blood of the alps on the ground!

578
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:28,866
I will kill you with them.

579
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Come on, come on!

580
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,923
orhan.

581
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:06,917
Masallah!

582
01:15:08,312 --> 01:15:09,780
"Oh right!"

583
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:20,550
Oh right!

584
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:24,078
Oh right!

585
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:26,610
Oh my god!

586
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:34,390
Oh God!
- Oh God!

587
01:15:37,712 --> 01:15:39,712
"Oh right!"

588
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,880
I say we should test Avcı Bey Konur.

589
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:55,803
That's how we assign it.

590
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,336
Show your trick.

591
01:16:45,603 --> 01:16:46,739
You are adept.

592
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:54,785
You will be both my guard and my squire in an equal position to the hunter.

593
01:16:58,638 --> 01:16:59,774
Go now.

594
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:20,267
Can we trust this, my sultan?

595
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:23,657
I will make moves that will blow Osman apart.

596
01:17:25,657 --> 01:17:33,171
It disperses... It knows very well that I am the branch to cling to.

597
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:39,555
Both Turgut and Konur are just the beginning, Avcı Bey.

598
01:17:40,219 --> 01:17:42,551
This location is very close.

599
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:45,000
I keep those I trust close to me.

600
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:50,230
I keep the ones I don't trust closer to me.

601
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,153
Don't take your eyes off this Konur.

602
01:17:55,884 --> 01:18:00,000
Until we're sure it's us.

603
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:01,825
It is your command, my sultan.

604
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,651
Olof! We will not succeed!

605
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:17,991
Back off!

606
01:18:30,784 --> 01:18:34,445
Olof, I took the head of one of you today

607
01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:36,882
I'll take your heads tomorrow!

608
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:40,410
Mashallah, mashallah to my valiants.

609
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:52,974
Sons... You're welcome to come.

610
01:18:56,761 --> 01:19:02,149
Mashallah, mashallah to you, your heart is as strong as your wrist.

611
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:07,737
As long as you stand shoulder to shoulder like this, by Allah's leave, no one can stand before us.

612
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:09,737
"Goodbye, sir."

613
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:17,258
Boran brother, nothing will happen to you, nothing will happen to you

614
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:22,070
Is this scar worth it to you? Are you okay my guardian?

615
01:19:23,532 --> 01:19:25,532
Sir Boran! Sir!

616
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:27,930
Bro!

617
01:19:33,257 --> 01:19:39,249
My lord is coming, my lord is coming, are you okay, my guardian? are you okay shhh...

618
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:47,428
Boran, guard
- Sir

619
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:51,887
Just hold on.
- I'm fine, sir.

620
01:19:53,216 --> 01:19:57,556
Hold on, get ready quickly, we'll go to Yenişehir.
