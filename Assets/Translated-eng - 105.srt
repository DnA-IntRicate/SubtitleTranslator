1
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,607
They are the spoils of the fortress, Turgut Bey.

2
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,597
Brother, sir, do you think the fortress
who will you give it to?

3
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:35,615
Marmaracik... the most...

4
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:43,638
It suits Turgut Bey.

5
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,611
Do you think we are entitled, Cerkutay?

6
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,950
Will he find someone better than you, sir?

7
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,538
This is your right.

8
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,632
Thanks.

9
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,184
Thank you, Cerkutay.

10
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,372
Hey mashallah, mashallah!

11
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,356
Forty-one time!

12
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,870
This fortress is as empty as my name.

13
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,575
If Osman Bey could take these for himself...

14
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,018
My Turgut Bey!

15
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:37,398
He gives them to you too, it's your right.

16
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,632
And this place is up to me.

17
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,559
Before Osman Bey came,

18
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,502
what to yourself
Can you share it, Mr. Bayındır?

19
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,114
Where is Osman Bey?

20
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:58,146
I don't know where Osman Bey is.

21
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,176
When it will come, God knows.

22
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,791
But what are you doing?

23
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:04,885
Fine!

24
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:08,797
Then let's enlarge this barn with the alps.

25
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,492
We have many horses.

26
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:11,614
The barn is small.

27
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,618
No no.

28
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,418
Whatever we have to do, we do.

29
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:15,937
You go back to your workbench.

30
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,950
Don't lose your money.

31
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,100
Lets.

32
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,550
Is there no man to stand at the counter?

33
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,320
He has no business here.

34
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,810
Get back to your own business.

35
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,335
You have no duty here, Mr. Bayindir.

36
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,697
We have a lot of duties, gentlemen.

37
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,570
Let's act, valiants!

38
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,960
What are you after?

39
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,980
Where is Osman Bey?

40
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,308
I'll be back at my workbench, but...

41
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,860
If you start a business against me,

42
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,217
I will destroy the world on your head.

43
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:06,126
Lets.

44
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,265
Thank God, my sons
Karaca left for Hisar.

45
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,886
Even if both are one,
it makes me feel comfortable.

46
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,870
Brother takes the burden of brother, of course.

47
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,878
Don't be left behind, either.

48
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,500
They take good care of each other.

49
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,437
How are the preparations?

50
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,982
We loaded the supplies into the car, Malhun Hatun.

51
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,867
We have no shortcomings, thank goodness.

52
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,429
Alps, be on your guard.

53
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,512
The order is yours, Malhun Hatun.

54
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,770
So black
What do you think, Malhun Hatun?

55
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,440
Has the longing for a child started already?

56
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,900
I think of Osman Bey.

57
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,790
He summoned us

58
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,640
he was not in Marmaracik.

59
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,730
He didn't tell anyone where he was.

60
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,152
I was wondering so.

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,566
Once upon a time, my father used to say:

62
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,217
even for a breath
In this world where we cannot rule,

63
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,210
You will never be a renegade.

64
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,640
Are the survivors here?

65
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,360
Are the secrets here?

66
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,480
Now you can be the ayan.

67
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,770
Osman Bey!

68
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,350
Selamunaleyküm, sir.

69
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,940
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,020
Mashallah my valiant!

71
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,870
Robust.

72
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,135
Let's say if the task is complete.

73
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,758
All right, sir.

74
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,220
Now is the time.

75
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,420
Marmaracık opened the door of conquest.

76
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,260
Now,

77
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,420
We will conquer Köprühisar.

78
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,240
Sir, shoot and let's shoot.

79
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,433
Let's break it.
We are always behind you.

80
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,078
Are you behind us?

81
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,304
stagnant water turns into swamp.

82
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,430
But running water is not polluted.

83
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,890
We will be floods of enthusiasm and march on them.

84
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,130
You say now.

85
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,280
What's the weather like in Köprühisar?

86
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,020
Where do you get all these vaccines?

87
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,088
Sir, a horse cannot pass without barley.

88
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:50,600
Backless Cherry, the enemy cannot break.

89
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,460
Since the map is there,

90
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,550
You have important things to tell me.

91
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,910
Yes, sir.

92
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,510
All in all!
You should look at this Turgut Bey.

93
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,960
You think, on the infidel
walks alone, shoots alone.

94
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,674
If it wasn't for me, inside the walls
Could they enter, Hussein?

95
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:55,879
They couldn't get in, sir.

96
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:56,980
They couldn't go in.

97
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,359
But from now on they see.

98
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,020
My name is--

99
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,805
Will Bayındır be in trouble?

100
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,220
Alps!

101
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,270
Treat the pusats!

102
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,804
Who are you, what do you want?

103
00:11:56,824 --> 00:12:00,170
What we want is to agree with you.

104
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,970
But for that we have to stop.

105
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,110
Are you a jinn or a jinn?

106
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,218
I don't know the copy.

107
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,618
What would I agree with you for?

108
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,944
I'll take you to Olof.

109
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,540
First of all,

110
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,983
Let's see the face under that mask.

111
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
Yenişehir,

112
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,560
elegant fabric maker, Marta Hatun, huh.

113
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,350
Phrygian

114
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,194
My name is Phrygian.

115
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
Was that demon you?

116
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,550
Olof's boy?

117
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,370
er?

118
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,600
What would Olof want to deal with me?

119
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,220
You talk to him.

120
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,070
On top of all the things I know,

121
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,580
a face under the mask has also been added.

122
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,026
Don't say that I'm doing something wrong,

123
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:23,590
I will burn you all.

124
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,280
I know a lot too.

125
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,016
For example, that you stole gold from Olof,

126
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,281
Mr. Bayindir.

127
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,500
As you know,

128
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,970
as i know,
it can lead you to death.

129
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,360
But,

130
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,030
He called you alive.

131
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,028
Make up your mind now, Bayindir.

132
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,372
Either I will kill you here,

133
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,930
or we'll go to Olof together.

134
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,484
While you have the opportunity,

135
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,870
since you didn't kill me,

136
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,720
I mean you have to.

137
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,800
Fine.

138
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:19,986
Let's go to Olof Effendi, let's see.

139
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,620
What did he say?

140
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,960
So, the conquest of Marmaracik
ravaged them, heh.

141
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,040
Their hearts tremble with fear.

142
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,770
But these odors also increase the precautions.

143
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,610
to the emperor,

144
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,300
They have written letters and are waiting for support.

145
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,970
They are afraid.

146
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:07,415
They are afraid.

147
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:10,090
After Bilecik,
how we marched on İnegöl,

148
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,440
now too,

149
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,910
They know that we will march to Köprühisar.

150
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,162
What is the task, you say.

151
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,470
They were getting blacksmiths from the villages.

152
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,660
To repair the walls.

153
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,410
By taking the workers away from their jobs,
They dig a trench.

154
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,760
They also increased patrols.

155
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,370
Marcus!

156
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
What is this outfit?

157
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,900
Osman!

158
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,630
Attack!

159
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:06,160
You know what to do.

160
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,480
disperse!

161
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,581
I'll go now, sir.

162
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:22,870
No, with me
You will come to Marmaracik.

163
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,687
Kuffar's fortress
When I made the Turkish homeland,

164
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,730
you'll see what it is.

165
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,260
Lets.

166
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,680
The command is my lord.

167
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,810
the hardest part
It is to eat without contaminating haram.

168
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,070
Let's go back to our city,
Let me fill my stomach like this.

169
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,050
Lets.

170
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,080
Lowflower!

171
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,170
Any news from the Alps?

172
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,039
Has Osman Bey returned to Yenişehir?

173
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,403
No, dad.
He did not come at night.

174
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,876
Our Alps are still eyes.

175
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,500
Osman does not stop, he runs water under the straw.
That's how he does his job.

176
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,470
You just sit here and wait for him,
that I will gas.

177
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,690
Bayindir is not there either.

178
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:27,220
These two would do well without us, but...

179
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,783
This silence is not a good omen.

180
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,036
What job has Osman done so far?
it was for our good, Mr. Öktem?

181
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's see what trouble it will cause us again.

182
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,770
Is there a destur, sir?

183
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,836
Subaşı Aktemur wants to see you.

184
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,410
Here you go.

185
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,260
Selamun aleykum.

186
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,290
And aleykum salam.

187
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,230
Lower your head.

188
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,550
Just say it, Subasi.

189
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,141
I bring you Osman Bey's greetings.

190
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,730
Mr. Osman,

191
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,270
awaits you in Marmaracik Fortress.

192
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Marmaracik?

193
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,460
Marmaracik,

194
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,240
It is the property of the non-Turk.

195
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,754
Osman Bey conquered Marmaracik.

196
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,707
In the evening, he arranges a wedding for the masters of the sentence.

197
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,074
He awaits you in his new property.

198
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,224
Thanks.

199
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:34,891
Leave!

200
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,030
stealing my gold

201
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,750
You killed my men, Bayindir.

202
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,960
If I counted you as my enemy,

203
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,918
I couldn't miss.

204
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:07,980
That ax was stuck in your head.

205
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,630
Be sure.

206
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,350
I know everything you do.

207
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,870
Gold was also a common property.

208
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,000
Even if you owned it

209
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,780
it was not to benefit anyone else.

210
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,040
Eh!

211
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,460
Just say,

212
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,789
why did you call me here?

213
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,390
I want

214
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,990
deal with you.

215
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,920
against Osman.

216
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,830
to act together.

217
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,910
Olof lord.

218
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,220
Why should I help you?

219
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,040
Who are you?

220
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,050
Well, who are you,

221
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,540
I'm going to sell the huge Osman Bey to you?

222
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,808
Choose the truth.

223
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,760
Be on my side.

224
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,900
Or together with Osman,

225
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,000
you lose too.

226
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,160
By my temperament,

227
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,168
I will not stand on the side to be defeated.

228
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:18,030
Never tire yourself out.

229
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,760
Bring.

230
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,437
These golds are for you.

231
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,870
With that little thing?
will you fool me?

232
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,370
My treasure,

233
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
up to the sea.

234
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,050
These,

235
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,290
just a drop.

236
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,880
Don't ever tire your jaw for nothing.

237
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,716
I am next to Osman Bey,

238
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,040
a thousand times that

239
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,350
I win in conquest.

240
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,120
His booty is abundant, alhamdulillah.

241
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,050
Osman's spoils
Do you believe he will give it to you?

242
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,260
He is using you.

243
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,200
your life, your property,

244
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,990
For Osman to take Marmaracik,
you revealed.

245
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:35,510
So what will he do?

246
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,990
Who do you think he will give Marmaracık to?

247
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,883
This is the issue between us.

248
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,010
Well, with this issue,

249
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,640
you have no interest.

250
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,100
Don't worry for nothing, girl.

251
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,870
Fine.

252
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:59,990
We said, we said he to your offer.

253
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,600
What will I gain?

254
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
Half of my treasure.

255
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,940
But not just here.

256
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,230
in Constantinople,

257
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,096
I will make you a partner in my treasure.

258
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,960
Osman Bey is very important.

259
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,650
But,

260
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,580
Gold is also very important.

261
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,600
So what I'm saying is,

262
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,390
this is such a moment
It is not a matter to be decided.

263
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,750
give me a little time,

264
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,710
let me think.

265
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,410
I'll let you know my decision tonight.

266
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,180
Think.

267
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,656
Think, but...

268
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,380
If you try to sell us

269
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,040
My ax won't miss this time.

270
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,580
Don't forget this either.

271
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,059
olof lord,

272
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,770
me like this again, bare sword,

273
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,290
you will find it difficult.

274
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,970
If your wrist is enough for my hundred horses,

275
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,400
you do what you say.

276
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,090
Take this.

277
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:21,460
Let him put on the blindfold, come on.

278
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,668
Come on, take it, come on.

279
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,770
This Bayindir's job is easy.

280
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:41,140
Osman!

281
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,169
He must have a fault.

282
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,820
When I find him, I'll finish him off.

283
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,190
Everyone around Osman,
Think of it as a flourish.

284
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,370
If we plant a seed of jealousy among them,

285
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,250
Yenişehir resolves itself.

286
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,170
your biggest weapon
you got it talking again, darling

287
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,780
no mortal,

288
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,730
cannot stand against your intelligence.

289
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,700
We'll take a thousand like you.

290
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,343
This fortress, leading to your sentence
I hope it will open the way.

291
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,070
Whoever is skilled in other wars,
be her property.

292
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,310
Is there anyone better than me?

293
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,200
Chasing gas for years,

294
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,117
you run, Turgut.

295
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,420
Whoever has watered this land with his blood,

296
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,690
property is also his right.

297
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,400
To Marmaracik Fortress,
Grant us to judge properly.

298
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,060
Estagfurullah.

299
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,190
Who gave you this right?

300
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,130
Osman Bey, did he say, take this fortress, it is yours?

301
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:48,030
Then what do you say to yourself?

302
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,430
Masallah,

303
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,610
The throne suits you well, Turgut Bey.

304
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,290
But don't get too established.

305
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,529
You know, we're nomads.

306
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:23,470
We have no inclination, Boran Gardaş.

307
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,128
He'll sit on my Obama's post
There's no time, you know.

308
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,976
Osman Bey, I hope,
gives you dominion of the fort.

309
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,560
Thanks.

310
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,240
God knows, of course.

311
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,930
We'll see, guard.

312
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,460
Do you see, Mr. Öktem?

313
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,920
You, Marmaracik
You used to say that we will take it with Osman Bey.

314
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,890
While you're sitting in the room
Osman does not take a breath.

315
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,960
If he did such a secret job,

316
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,420
there is one he knows.

317
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,700
Let's go to Marmaracık,

318
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,888
we'll find out, what is it?

319
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,730
What will happen?

320
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,310
He calls to intimidate with his power.

321
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,130
Is your wound healed, Subaşı?

322
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,420
Depends on which wound you ask.

323
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,779
Not every wound heals, Alçiçek Hatun.

324
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,740
Are you hurt a lot?

325
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,040
Hello there.

326
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,910
And aleykum salam.

327
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,320
No, where is this, Mr. Öktem,

328
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,070
to the mail?

329
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,955
Osman Bey invited him to Marmaracık.

330
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,600
We go there.
Don't you know?

331
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,890
None.

332
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,460
Nobody said anything to us.

333
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,200
Subasi!

334
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:48,480
Do you know why we weren't called?

335
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,990
I have no knowledge.

336
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,264
I am in charge of calling Öktem Bey.

337
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,780
Lowflower!

338
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,530
Come this again.

339
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,970
I've got my eye on you, Alflower.

340
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,840
You name it accordingly.

341
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,415
Well, since.

342
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,140
You have a nice way.

343
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,500
Thanks!
You too, Mr.

344
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,710
Wow Osman Bey, wow!

345
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,990
So he takes the fort with me,
then you ignore me

346
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,660
You can set up a wedding without us.

347
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,710
Is there such a world, Huseyin?

348
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:16,490
No, sir.

349
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,210
Hisar, whose right is it?

350
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,620
We paved the way for conquest.

351
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,300
What happens if you don't give the castle to the one who paved the way?

352
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,110
Chest chest of gold came out,
They didn't even give our share.

353
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,680
late to the counter,
The Merchant is Bayindir, they said.

354
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,360
These are the cardigan of conquest,

355
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,770
they only suit themselves.

356
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,363
that cardigan they put on,

357
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,810
If I don't tear it apart

358
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,030
They shouldn't call me Bayındır Bey either.

359
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,336
What shall we do, sir?

360
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,424
Since they do not deem us worthy,

361
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,850
burning this earth under their feet,

362
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,690
I will make it hell!

363
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,620
You should be thankful you're alive,

364
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,380
why are you pouting your face?

365
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,870
I look at what you've done to my fortress,

366
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,180
tragedy.

367
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,050
But like any tragedy,
this too will end in blood.

368
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,210
The blood that flows will be your blood.

369
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,960
Look at those banners.

370
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,920
We do not hang it anywhere we do not water it with blood.

371
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,720
Be careful, the blood that sheds is not yours.

372
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,420
And look at these brave men!

373
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,940
They are the ones who run to death laughing.

374
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:51,870
Cantacuzenos,

375
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,390
don't forget.

376
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,620
Osman Bey, who sent you to Konstantini,

377
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,359
take care of your lands on the way.

378
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,530
Because we're going to come and get them all.

379
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:10,150
I suggest the same to you,
I will take back everything that belongs to us.

380
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,030
Even more.

381
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,720
We'll see, Your Royal Highness, we'll see.

382
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,690
We'll see, Turgut Bey.

383
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,950
My Osman Bey will come!

384
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,368
My Osman Bey will come!

385
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,220
My Osman Bey will come!

386
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,210
Selamun aleykum.

387
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,380
And aleykum salam.

388
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,889
Oh my god!

389
00:35:52,895 --> 00:35:55,020
It is these flags that make the country home.

390
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,810
Hallelujah.

391
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,220
You have equipped everything.

392
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,040
Hallelujah.

393
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,450
All of you, this is your happy day
welcome to the wedding.

394
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,500
Alps!

395
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,380
Let's meet your guardian, Gürbüz Alp.

396
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,330
Mr. Turgut.

397
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Welcome, Gürbüz Gardaş.

398
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,370
Welcome, guardian.

399
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,098
Like the interior of Marmaracik,
outside is ready too, Osman Bey.

400
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,530
He sweated a lot, valiant ones.

401
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,168
The ladies worked hard too, mashallah.

402
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:02,287
Thank you, thank you.

403
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,750
Welcome, Gurbuz.

404
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,623
Thank you.

405
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,187
Where were you on duty, guard?

406
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,050
You'll hear when the time comes.

407
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,538
Thanks.

408
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,930
Your secret is just as big as you, everyone.

409
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,610
Let's see, how many arrows will you shoot?

410
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,814
I'll blow your head off, your molasses will spill.

411
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,090
Then when you fall to the ground,

412
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,180
we will be on the same level.

413
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:35,650
Oh my god!

414
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,580
Where is Mr. Bayindir?

415
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,417
When you don't know when you will come,

416
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,414
I looked at himself to divide the booty.

417
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:50,930
So I said, go to work.

418
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,420
But evening comes, of course.

419
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,520
You did it wrong.

420
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,640
Without taking the booty from the place of conquest,
No one is sent.

421
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,260
Thank you, Osman Bey.

422
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,120
you're right.

423
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,170
Welcome, sir.

424
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,330
Mashallah, the market is full.

425
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,660
Things go well.

426
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,116
Don't talk, get out.
Lets!

427
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:46,738
The man builds a foal in his castle,

428
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,290
the market works.

429
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,727
from his seat,
wins his coin by clicking.

430
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:02,170
When you say let's go to the fort,

431
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,820
come on, Bayindir.

432
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,700
But hold on...

433
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,760
the day will come, the time will turn.

434
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,800
Now it's my turn.

435
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,220
Come on we said

436
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,548
I said hey to Olof's offer,

437
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,330
what the hell are you going to eat?

438
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,835
Repentance astaghfurullah,
repentance astaghfurullah.

439
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,910
Go over there, write what I say.
Lets!

440
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,880
Come on, Hussein!

441
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,380
The sun of Al-i Selcuk,

442
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,300
Sultana.

443
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,230
Just say, what is your exposure?

444
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,680
come one day,
We knew you'd get this place.

445
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,144
Is this a white day or a black day?

446
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,269
Is our coming salvation for you?

447
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,770
or persecution?

448
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,370
Is the day white or black,
you will show.

449
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:38,430
No.

450
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,020
your soul too

451
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,430
your property and your faith.
it is entrusted to me.

452
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,950
None will be harmed.

453
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,160
You will live freely.

454
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,470
What about taxes?

455
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,540
We heard you dropped them too.

456
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,598
The prosperity of our domination,
you heard too.

457
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:08,419
Don't worry, it will all fall.

458
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,650
You were ahead that day.

459
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,167
Will you be the ruler of the fort?

460
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,287
I haven't decided yet.

461
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,280
Everyone will know when the time comes.

462
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,922
Cerkutay!

463
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,210
Cerkutay!

464
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,320
I can't hear, you know!
Hear--

465
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,960
hey, hey.
I know.

466
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,978
I can't hear!

467
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,105
I know, I know.
You do not hear.

468
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,058
Good thing you don't, if you did,

469
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,450
What my Osman Bey said.

470
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,800
Would you stop here?

471
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,120
I'm deaf but...

472
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,669
I'm listening to you.

473
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,980
Tell me, pour it out.

474
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,050
What did he say?

475
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,572
No.

476
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,750
Why can't I tell a man who doesn't hear?

477
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
But I have heard such things!

478
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,070
You burned, Cerkutay, you burned!

479
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,140
What did he say?

480
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,930
Did he say about me?

481
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,560
sir?

482
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,800
What did he say, Ülgen Hatun?
Don't crack me up.

483
00:42:58,077 --> 00:42:59,759
What, Cerkutay?

484
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:01,388
You hear it, you!

485
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,788
So you tricked me, huh?

486
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:06,423
So you played me!

487
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:08,181
So you played me!

488
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:09,400
I ate you!

489
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,339
I ate you!

490
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,072
Don't run away, come.

491
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,078
Don't run away!

492
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:14,199
Come, don't run away, Cerkutay!

493
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,203
I'll paralyze you!

494
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,470
Good luck with your conquest, sir.

495
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,497
May you exist, Malhun, may you exist.

496
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:25,910
Marmaracik takes us to our destination
one step closer.

497
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,210
Thanks to you, we got closer, Osman.

498
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,120
Without stopping for a moment, without rest,
You run towards the target.

499
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,080
Your job is too hard.

500
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,330
Just say, how are the children?

501
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,040
Orhan and Alaeddin,
I went to Karacahisar.

502
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,130
Fatma and Halime,
they are with chicks in the mansion.

503
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,300
What about the situation in Yenişehir?

504
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,900
This Phrygian chick,
any news from him?

505
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,350
Not for now, sir.

506
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,070
But the fall of his mask is near.

507
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:00,832
Hopefully.

508
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,540
Hopefully, he will be too.

509
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,740
Sir,

510
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,110
Who will you give Marmaracik to?

511
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,388
Do you have a name in mind?

512
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,770
Won't you tell me too, my Osman?

513
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,350
When the time comes, everyone
He will know, Malhun.

514
00:45:07,912 --> 00:45:09,380
Is there a destur, my sultan?

515
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,807
Come, Hunter.

516
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,440
My Valide Sultan, Bayındır Bey,
He sent news from Yenişehir.

517
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,620
Read what he wrote, Mr. Bayındır.

518
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,900
The sun of Al-i Selcuk,
I am Valide Sultan.

519
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:44,830
Read.

520
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,180
Osman Bey is out of the principality.

521
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,700
Unity of the informal state,

522
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,520
has been threatened.

523
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,300
including Constantinople,

524
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,380
meddling in internal affairs

525
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,740
bring us all kinds of trouble

526
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,400
causes pain.

527
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,946
As it is not enough, by making conquests

528
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,590
gets stronger day by day.

529
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,999
At best, the power of the extreme is the power of Al-i Selçuk.

530
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,020
stolen from his power.

531
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,580
My Valide Sultan, whose power makes the world tremble,

532
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,830
come, see and see your power,

533
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,828
crush the questioners.

534
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,819
Your weak servant is Bayindir.

535
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,630
While we struggle to exist here,

536
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,400
Osman uses this as an opportunity.

537
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,348
that we feed with our hands,

538
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,468
if he betrays,

539
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,979
fate,

540
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,000
it is obvious.

541
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,020
that we feed with our hands,

542
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,470
with our feet,

543
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,210
we crush

544
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,150
I have this power.

545
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,720
I will not stop using it.

546
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:29,970
Hunter,

547
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,680
Prepare your best warriors.

548
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,180
We are going to Yenişehir.

549
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,778
What are we going to do, my sultan?

550
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,740
We will destroy the rebels.

551
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,980
Or kneel down
they will declare their allegiance to us,

552
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:52,480
or

553
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,990
with my very dear bird,

554
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,040
They will share the same fate.

555
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,740
Destur!

556
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,080
Mr. Osman!

557
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,300
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

558
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,871
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

559
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,810
Selamun aleykum.

560
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,190
And aleykum salam.

561
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:53,958
Have a good evening.

562
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,040
Marmaracik Fortress,

563
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,420
it wasn't just a property for us.

564
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,490
to our land,

565
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,190
It was the home of those who wanted to spread strife.

566
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,690
But

567
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,380
We dismantled them all.

568
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,720
For that reason,

569
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,320
our wedding table today,
We do it on our own property.

570
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,100
To my Lord, who showed us today,
thank you.

571
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,792
Amine!

572
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:33,787
Amine!

573
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,790
Here you are.

574
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,546
Congratulations on your new property, Osman Bey.

575
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,770
But we are not offended.

576
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,700
In such a conquest,

577
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,160
We would like to be with you.

578
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Mr. Oktem,

579
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,470
Every conquest has a secret.

580
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,940
Sometimes this secret

581
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,050
it becomes the key to the conquest.

582
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,610
Thanks.

583
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,550
Gentlemen!

584
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,190
because we did not invite you to conquer,
do not be offended.

585
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:46,800
We will have many more conquests.

586
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,510
If not today,

587
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,087
Tomorrow we will strike the neck of the infidel together.

588
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,390
Our banner together
we will move forward.

589
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,537
Hopefully!

590
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,270
Hopefully.

591
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,360
May you exist!

592
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,680
Huh, Kantakouzenos?

593
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,610
How are you?

594
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,640
Do they host well?

595
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,490
As you said, Osman Bey,

596
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,610
account of what you've done to me
I will ask you.

597
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,110
If not today,

598
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:23,930
tomorrow.

599
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,500
For Kantakouzenos
You put poison, didn't you?

600
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:37,900
Have fun with you, prince.

601
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,310
Eat it.

602
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,240
I know.

603
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,110
But I also know how to take revenge.

604
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,620
You say we won't stop, Osman Bey, huh?

605
00:52:51,098 --> 00:52:52,282
We will not stop.

606
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:54,080
It is not fit for us to stand still, Mr. Öktem.

607
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,570
We will continue with new conquests.

608
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,230
Good good.

609
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:01,220
Now you have made our hearts, Osman Bey.

610
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,856
Thank you, thank you.

611
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:09,540
What a secretive chick you are, Malhun Hatun.

612
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,890
We came, we asked, we did but
You gave a secret, you did not give a secret.

613
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,820
But I'm taken, a little.

614
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,060
Are we enemies?

615
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,130
Why this secrecy?

616
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,057
Estagfurullah, Bengi Hatun.

617
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:27,471
State secrets are not extorted.

618
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,710
Our attitude is not unique to you.

619
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,580
Bala Hatun,

620
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,669
you were also in the conquest, huh?

621
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,710
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,300
Mashallah, Bala Hatun.

623
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,740
Doesn't stop for a moment, after her,
you run from battle to battle.

624
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,890
We hear about their victories, we are proud.

625
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,000
Estagfurullah.

626
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,838
It is the victory of our sisters, not ours.

627
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,500
lowflower,

628
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,280
one day you will come to our drills.

629
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,227
I would love to, Bala Hatun.

630
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,450
Selamun aleykum.

631
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,713
Aleykum salam.

632
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,080
Enjoy your meal.

633
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,890
You brought joy, my Sheikh.

634
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,770
I found pleasure, Osman Bey.

635
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,538
your conquest,

636
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,788
Congratulations, Osman Bey.

637
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,609
Be there, be there.

638
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:48,880
a

639
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,970
O my God, the owner of the properties!

640
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,280
You give the property to whom you will,

641
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,730
You can take the property from whomever you wish.

642
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,740
He humiliates whom He wills,

643
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,540
you bless what you wish.

644
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,690
No, it's in your hands.

645
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,480
No doubt,

646
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,450
You are all-powerful.

647
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:18,890
on your way,

648
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,450
fighting valiants,

649
00:55:21,968 --> 00:55:22,985
make a saint.

650
00:55:23,005 --> 00:55:23,924
Amine.

651
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,930
In this holy cause,

652
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,150
make us always victorious.

653
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,057
Amine.

654
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:31,584
Amine.

655
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,006
Here you are my Sheikh, you are welcome.

656
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:48,226
Thanks.

657
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,950
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

658
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:57,196
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

659
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,300
Mr. Osman,

660
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,700
An unclaimed property is like a windless banner.

661
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,130
Who will dominate,

662
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,390
won't you say?

663
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,690
I will say.

664
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,100
Sure, I will say.

665
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,930
But the owner of the property

666
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,240
I will explain tomorrow.

667
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,580
Come on, let's.

668
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,810
Enjoy your meal.

669
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,450
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

670
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,680
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

671
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,730
Thanks.

672
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,997
Our sword is like a shield, but.

673
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:14,374
Repentance astaghfurullah,
Check out the moves.

674
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:16,234
Gee!

675
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:45,549
Eat.

676
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:47,967
Rather.

677
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,310
We do not eat an animal that is slaughtered without basmala.

678
00:58:52,828 --> 00:58:53,952
You know.

679
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:55,780
we eat.

680
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,050
It's okay.

681
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,350
You made the right decision.

682
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,740
Our Union

683
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,290
It will bring the end of Osman.

684
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,510
I'm not the guy to deal with infidelity.

685
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,580
Yav, I didn't like you very much either.

686
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,480
Get the news.

687
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:31,390
However, Osman Bey misled me a lot.

688
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,090
He did me a big mistake.

689
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:36,769
one who sacrifices,

690
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,570
me,

691
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,150
He couldn't keep up with her.

692
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:43,870
Me too,

693
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,820
I have no choice but to deal with you.

694
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:49,600
Osman was wrong.

695
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,308
He mistook the real queen as a pawn.

696
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,667
But being with us
when he knocked it down

697
00:59:56,839 --> 00:59:58,667
He will face the bitter truth.

698
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,040
He will face.

699
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,618
He will face.

700
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,680
The price of being ungrateful to me,

701
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,573
the state will see it by waking up from its dream.

702
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:13,650
Never forget what Osman did to you.

703
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,950
Keep your anger alive.

704
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,339
hold that

705
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,700
While destroying Osman,

706
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,009
you will need.

707
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,130
You should never worry about it.

708
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,050
When I make a promise, I keep it.

709
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,749
We'll get on well with you, lord Olof.

710
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,040
And we'll get along very well.

711
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:06,860
Give the sherbets, Ulgen Hatun.

712
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,347
Mom, stop!

713
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,086
Not a lot.

714
01:01:09,106 --> 01:01:10,486
You can distract my mother a little bit.

715
01:01:10,595 --> 01:01:11,310
Girl, what are you saying?

716
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,570
Your mother eats me raw.

717
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:13,924
Lowflower!

718
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,509
Take sherbet, Subasi.

719
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,060
Lowflower!

720
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,780
Don't get up.

721
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,100
My mother will see.

722
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:50,040
Tomorrow morning, when the sun is high,

723
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,230
Let's meet by the tree we plowed low.

724
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,500
Alçiçek Hatun,

725
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,310
what does this mean?

726
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,548
Buy sherbet.

727
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,350
Well, Bengi Hatun?

728
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,100
You're a beautiful girl too, mashallah.

729
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:11,062
Alçiçek has taken your beauty from you.

730
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,360
Dont forget.

731
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,780
I will wait.

732
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,860
Oh my eyes are dazzled!

733
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,120
How can this shine bright, like the moon, mashallah!

734
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:23,710
Ulgen Hatun.

735
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,209
Get out.

736
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,780
Alps!

737
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,150
Let's pull the pusats.

738
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,500
The command is my lord.

739
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,484
Goodbye, sir.

740
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:34,544
Come on, guards.

741
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:35,850
Come on bismillah!

742
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,741
Oh my god!

743
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:18,860
Oh my god!

744
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,690
Oh my god!

745
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,530
May you exist, valiants.

746
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,780
O throne,

747
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,050
tell me.

748
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,060
How many brave hearts have you ripped out?

749
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,670
You destroyed the family.

750
01:07:34,562 --> 01:07:35,949
O throne!

751
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:02,949
O throne!

752
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,460
Talk.

753
01:08:08,557 --> 01:08:09,752
Talk.

754
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,522
Talk Talk.

755
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:16,736
Talk.

756
01:08:29,756 --> 01:08:30,779
Talk.

757
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,720
How many states have you been to hell?

758
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:57,510
How many states have you been to hell?

759
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,070
Don't touch me.

760
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,499
Don't come in front of me.

761
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,678
Don't try to set me up.

762
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:16,630
Do not!
Or....

763
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,419
I said don't let anyone in.

764
01:09:29,968 --> 01:09:32,420
Has the throne already bent its back, Osman?

765
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:09,254
I'm afraid.

766
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,387
I'm afraid, Sheikh.

767
01:10:11,987 --> 01:10:13,179
I'm so afraid.

768
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,960
You should be afraid already.

769
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,460
If I were a gentleman too,

770
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,450
I was also very scared, I would have exploded.

771
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,660
My liver would be purulent.

772
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,300
The throne will be my grave.

773
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,600
I'll eat it with the ground.

774
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,410
Before,

775
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,700
domination of his own soul.

776
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:51,270
You are now a gentleman.

777
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,010
You are the master of your beautiful soul.

778
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:56,500
nice brain,

779
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,180
of Alp,

780
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,400
You are the lord of the merchant.

781
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,320
you have judged your own soul.

782
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,800
Or the soul of the people?

783
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,790
Or your men

784
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,570
endless desires?

785
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,940
They'll want booty.

786
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,640
They will want a position.

787
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,810
They'll want supplies.

788
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:28,968
They will want order, they will want peace.

789
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:33,500
They will want it and they will want it.

790
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:34,850
If you give,

791
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,160
what a good

792
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,520
If you don't...

793
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:42,861
If I don't,

794
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,100
I will be the worst.

795
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,700
Because of that,

796
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,000
Bey is always alone, Osman Bey.

797
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,700
You look from the outside
There are many servants with him.

798
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,240
However,

799
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,994
aspiring to be chief,

800
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:09,059
consent to be alone
willing to show.

801
01:12:10,844 --> 01:12:12,600
What is loneliness, my Sheikh?

802
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:14,932
What is loneliness?

803
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:18,039
They will die for you,

804
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,480
the day comes,

805
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,020
becomes your worst enemy.

806
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:25,290
Your spouse, whom you lay your head on the same pillow,

807
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,229
makes an alliance with your enemy.

808
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:30,800
You are the child you tremble,

809
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,440
the day comes,

810
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,320
to get the lordship,
calls you to the battlefield.

811
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,140
And,

812
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:42,480
nice test, my Osman.

813
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,790
What is the cure, my Sheikh?

814
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,110
Bey's devil will be great.

815
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,110
To get rid of this mortal enemy,

816
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,230
you will be awake.

817
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,170
How can I be?

818
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,780
You will not be mistaken.

819
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,919
How will I not fall, my Sheikh?

820
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,700
How can I not fall?

821
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,220
Opening your heart's eyes.

822
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,350
How will he be?

823
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,530
your nights,

824
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,690
You will spend it with contemplation and dhikr.

825
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,410
Morning prayer is not enough.

826
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,050
You will make your tahajjud.

827
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,870
You will keep the sunnah fasts.

828
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,890
Everyone,

829
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,200
while giving one

830
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,150
You will give a thousand.

831
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:54,443
You will erase the ornament of the world from your heart.

832
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,281
You will not hurt Tawhid.

833
01:13:57,763 --> 01:14:01,610
Always reciting the Qur'an,

834
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,620
If you light up your night and day,

835
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,450
you stay awake.

836
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,990
When you're awake,

837
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,440
your eyes are opened.

838
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,890
As your heart opens,

839
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,790
when you speak,
when you see,

840
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,970
when you think,
divine manifestation to you,

841
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,830
there will be a torrential downpour.

842
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,600
Your subjects, who see these states of you,

843
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,760
gradually comes to pass.

844
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,650
However,

845
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:42,880
Every rose has thorns, Bey Osman.

846
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,530
My Yigit Osman!

847
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,200
This will be your test.

848
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,330
The main thing is that from that test

849
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,680
Isn't it successful?

850
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:58,039
Allah saves us from trials
May he grant us victory, my Sheikh.

851
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,700
Amine.

852
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:02,560
Amine.

853
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,470
Masallah!

854
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:27,889
Mashallah, mashallah!

855
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,970
Sir!

856
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:37,790
This Olof sounds very uncanny to me, though.

857
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:48,010
You with a brain like that bird,
Do you question my judgment?

858
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,720
Estagfurullah, sir.

859
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:52,468
I, so that no harm will come to you.

860
01:15:52,471 --> 01:15:54,746
The real harm to me comes from Osman.

861
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:56,590
Marma--

862
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,220
In the conquest of Marmaracik,

863
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,240
Didn't I put my life in the middle?

864
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:06,670
Leave my life, my property
Didn't I put it in the middle?

865
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:08,560
What did Osman do?

866
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,920
That pintail Turgut,
brought it up to us.

867
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:15,293
You know best, sir.

868
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:16,444
I know.

869
01:16:16,464 --> 01:16:17,301
I know, sure.

870
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,780
When trying to go to the conquest,

871
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,140
"Come, Bayindir, to help."

872
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:30,769
When the conquest is over and the naive is set,
"Come on, Bayindir, to your counter."

873
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,330
Such ungratefulness,

874
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,170
but someone like Osman Bey,
befits a monument of arrogance.

875
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,060
But stop you

876
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:43,090
Stop.

877
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:47,110
I deleted them all, all of them.

878
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:49,570
From Osman to Turgut,

879
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:51,340
until Öktem.

880
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,190
Now unite with Olof.

881
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,770
I will do what he wants,

882
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,140
and he will make his gold a ladder for my feet.

883
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:04,600
With that ladder

884
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,399
I will ride on Osman's top.

885
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,050
He used Bayındır and took the fortress.

886
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,920
But toya did not call Bayındır.

887
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,870
See, take your step accordingly, sir.

888
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,023
I see, babe.

889
01:17:27,422 --> 01:17:28,860
I see, but I don't understand.

890
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,440
Why Bayındır
doesn't he call us?

891
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,770
He took the fort, he was done with Bayındır.

892
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,270
Now to you and to the other gentlemen,

893
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,922
intimidates, shows his power.

894
01:17:44,111 --> 01:17:45,690
Let's see who will give the castle to whom?

895
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,520
Marmaracik,

896
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,930
on our route of conquest,

897
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,410
stretches out like a ram.

898
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,680
If we are not cautious,

899
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,910
they will take this place away from us.

900
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,400
What does the measure say, Osman Bey?

901
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,070
We will not stop.

902
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,210
If we stop

903
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,670
here, their swords
We'll stretch it out.

904
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,240
But if we walk

905
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:19,710
at that time,

906
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:24,100
to their attacks,
We will fight with our bronze hearts.

907
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,780
We will take Köprühisar.

908
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,280
Sir,

909
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:32,380
don't you have to stop?

910
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,420
They are on the alert now.

911
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,890
They think so too.

912
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,290
After Bilecik, on İnegöl
how we walked

913
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,950
After Marmaracik,

914
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,790
Over Köprühisar
They think we're going to walk.

915
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,210
they recruit soldiers from the villages,
strengthen the walls.

916
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,299
What is your move, Osman Bey?

917
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,130
We'll pretend to stop.

918
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,200
But in our secret preparations
we will continue.

919
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,120
they are our move
When you think we won't

920
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,480
We will strike them out of their complacency.

921
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,050
But still,

922
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,180
It will not be as easy as Marmaracik.

923
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,290
Who has seen our business easily, sir?

924
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,700
Call the gentlemen.

925
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,230
I will explain the judge of Marmaracik.

926
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:31,020
Then from the thesis
We will begin the preparations for the conquest.

927
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,660
Orhan!

928
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,382
Sir.

929
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,000
Summon Commander Remus.

930
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,890
The command is my lord.

931
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:57,630
If the conquest had called us,

932
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,550
I would have hope.

933
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,680
To give it to us. But,

934
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,830
it seems that

935
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,990
The fortress will belong to Turgut Bey.

936
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,840
That's why he doesn't call you!

937
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,560
Hisar was your right.

938
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:21,910
If you had joined the conquest,
would have to give it to you.

939
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,750
But now go again
He will give it to Turgut Bey.

940
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,920
You teach right.

941
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,990
You always say the right thing,

942
01:20:34,446 --> 01:20:36,120
I can't put it.

943
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,440
If you had listened to me

944
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:42,190
now fly bey, not Osman Bey,
you would be

945
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,390
Come on, come on.

946
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:48,520
We'll be late for the party.

947
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:49,924
Lets.

948
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:55,730
Doesn't Alçiçek go to the market?

949
01:20:56,841 --> 01:21:00,540
He has a job in the room, he will come when his job is done.

950
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:05,920
Mr. Baydir!

951
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,880
Are you inside?

952
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,170
Here you go, Shamil Alp.

953
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:17,300
Selamun aleykum.

954
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,380
aleykumselam

955
01:21:20,232 --> 01:21:21,470
No, Shamil Alp?

956
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,570
My Osman Bey sets up a sofa.

957
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,980
He orders all the gentlemen to respond.

958
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,240
The word of our lord is above our heads.

959
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,530
You go.

960
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,580
We'll be there before anyone else, I hope.

961
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,950
Why are you closing shop this time?

962
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:43,960
Shamil Alp,

963
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,200
you're in the shop!

964
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,850
The shop is open, not closed.

965
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,180
hey.

966
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,390
I saw the truth.

967
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:13,470
who stand against the truth,
I also saw how their heads fell.

968
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,450
can i trust you

969
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,359
If I couldn't trust

970
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,840
I already got your head.

971
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,710
Now you will go to the emperor.

972
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:44,420
Kantakouzenos, sole heir to the throne
You will say that you have

973
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:47,960
for trusting me
I am grateful, Osman Bey.

974
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:50,560
But...

975
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:54,090
If Kantakouzenos is in business with Olof,

976
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,050
Living is the last thing I want.

977
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,360
I know.

978
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,730
So just the news
I'll send you to pass it on.

979
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,100
You are loyal to the emperor.

980
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,666
If you stay here

981
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,090
It does not put Kantakouzenos alive.

982
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:15,850
I hope the Emperor
falling into the trap of these traitors,

983
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,490
He will not continue to enmity with you any longer.

984
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,620
You,

985
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,000
you are a good friend.

986
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,580
You are an honorable commander.

987
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,780
Have a nice trip.

988
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,740
Call the gentlemen.

989
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,480
The command is my lord.

990
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,749
We can't leave Remus in Osman's hands.

991
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,540
In Yenişehir, in Marmaracık,

992
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,440
You will have eyes everywhere.

993
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,410
You will follow him.

994
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,522
What does Osman want from Remus?

995
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:11,821
us it,

996
01:24:13,035 --> 01:24:13,590
that merchant

997
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,590
The lord will tell.

998
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,460
Thanks to him,

999
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,990
We will know every step Osman takes.

1000
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,500
If we keep Bayındır's gold abundant,

1001
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:32,910
continues to work for us.

1002
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,480
To bring the end of Osman,

1003
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:40,210
we can sacrifice a few golds, darling.

1004
01:24:40,746 --> 01:24:44,170
And when we're done with that merchant,

1005
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,160
We will get our gold back.

1006
01:24:52,769 --> 01:24:53,753
Selamun aleykum.

1007
01:24:53,773 --> 01:24:54,813
Selamun aleykum.

1008
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:57,060
And aleykum salam.

1009
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,654
Come, Gürbüz Alp, come.

1010
01:24:58,748 --> 01:25:00,579
You can get your shot here, come on.

1011
01:25:00,879 --> 01:25:01,872
you teach,

1012
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,840
you step on my veins, Baysungur.

1013
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,050
Here you go, Gürbüz Gardaş.

1014
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,880
No food. So there is, up to me.

1015
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,270
Cerkutay is insatiable, you will get used to it.

1016
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,920
You get used to it.

1017
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,740
Come, Ulgen sister, come.

1018
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,650
Ulgen sister, come.
Come, Gürbüz Alp is very hungry.

1019
01:25:35,009 --> 01:25:35,910
God bless your hands.

1020
01:25:39,995 --> 01:25:40,720
Enjoy your meal.

1021
01:25:44,705 --> 01:25:46,006
Ulgen Hatun!

1022
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:47,798
Enjoy your meal.

1023
01:25:48,952 --> 01:25:50,102
Enjoy your meal.

1024
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:51,872
Enjoy your meal.

1025
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:56,120
I am here, me.

1026
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,170
I don't hear.

1027
01:26:04,355 --> 01:26:06,610
Eat, eat. Enjoy your meal.

1028
01:26:10,388 --> 01:26:11,560
daddy.

1029
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:15,570
I'm hungry Ülgen Hatun, I'm hungry.
Ulgen Hatun!

1030
01:26:19,616 --> 01:26:20,858
Put it, put it, put it, put it, put it.

1031
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,440
Let him count what he ate all the time,

1032
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,889
Cerkutay Alp.

1033
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:34,028
Sister, fill some more.
This is not enough for the cavity of my tooth.

1034
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,060
It's a little bit, it's not enough for him

1035
01:26:42,555 --> 01:26:43,997
Put a little more, a little more.

1036
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,170
Ye my Cerkutay, eat.

1037
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:50,953
Also, when you reach Köprühisar,
You will be longing for Yenişehir's vaccine.

1038
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,420
Look, come on.

1039
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,870
Osman Bey is in Köprühisar
He will give you a task.

1040
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:04,360
Well...

1041
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,720
The hiccups got hold of me, that hiccup--

1042
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,790
Enjoy your meal.

1043
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:20,080
We hurt Ülgen Hatun a lot.

1044
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:31,044
Leave.

1045
01:27:31,064 --> 01:27:31,823
You leave.

1046
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,802
The strength of my wrist is from my heart
come, you said.

1047
01:27:38,602 --> 01:27:41,172
You'll be strong enough to eat that much, of course.

1048
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,620
Eat less, less.

1049
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,467
Leave.

1050
01:27:44,767 --> 01:27:45,370
Leave.

1051
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:47,785
You leave.

1052
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,200
Hey guards!

1053
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,660
There is enough food for all of you.

1054
01:27:54,661 --> 01:27:57,090
Come on, come on.
Eat your vaccine as soon as possible,

1055
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:58,370
A sofa will be set up.

1056
01:27:58,759 --> 01:27:59,560
Cerkutay, come on.

1057
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,320
Share some, share.

1058
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:03,640
You leave.

1059
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,460
What a Köprühisar, man!

1060
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,660
Where did this come from now?

1061
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,300
Oh my unfortunate head!

1062
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,190
Sir.

1063
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,640
Sir!

1064
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,710
The sofa is up.

1065
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,200
Why do we go down?

1066
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:45,240
Since the sofa is above,

1067
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,980
why do you follow me?

1068
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:48,230
Hush, okay.

1069
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,259
You wait here.

1070
01:28:51,066 --> 01:28:51,910
Don't follow me.

1071
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,018
What happens, Ülgen Hatun, are you crying?

1072
01:29:16,038 --> 01:29:17,491
What will happen?
Cerkutay

1073
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:19,290
Oh!

1074
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,320
Osman Bey,

1075
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:22,860
now too,

1076
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,380
He will take Köprühisar.

1077
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,120
Well, what's good, what's wrong with that?

1078
01:29:29,882 --> 01:29:31,280
There's nothing wrong with that, of course.

1079
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,920
The Turkish homeland expands.

1080
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,850
They widen,

1081
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,240
Osman Bey,

1082
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:41,010
Cerkutay too,

1083
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,120
He was going to assign him to Köprühisar.

1084
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,040
The joy of the host to go.

1085
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,170
Oh, I do not say for myself,

1086
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,699
In the absence of Cerkutay,

1087
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,020
Who will eat all that food?

1088
01:29:59,090 --> 01:29:59,780
From him.

1089
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,319
Mr. Osman!

1090
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,950
I knew it wouldn't stop, but...

1091
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,650
I didn't know its range.

1092
01:30:15,186 --> 01:30:16,759
Now I learned that too.

1093
01:30:18,199 --> 01:30:19,622
Köprühisar, huh?

1094
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,100
No, Mr. Bayindir?

1095
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,660
The sofa is not on this side.

1096
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:37,830
So was Essahtan.

1097
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:41,565
However, Osman Bey,
He built such a large mansion that

1098
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:45,040
where is the footpath, where is the sofa,
we got it all mixed up.

1099
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:48,204
Especially guards, just say a word,

1100
01:30:48,224 --> 01:30:49,211
Which side is the sofa on?

1101
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,770
The Divan is on this side, Bayındır Bey.

1102
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:52,132
Here you go.

1103
01:30:52,152 --> 01:30:53,408
Cheers, guards.

1104
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,470
Osman Bey walks to Köprühisar.

1105
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,320
Have Tez go to Olof and let him know.

1106
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,570
Mr. Osman!

1107
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,790
Selamun aleykum.

1108
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,460
And aleykum salam.

1109
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:47,860
Here you are.

1110
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,490
We are not from victory,

1111
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,340
responsible for the expedition,

1112
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,050
In the ninety-nine names of Almighty Allah,

1113
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:09,580
I open the sofa.

1114
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:13,561
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1115
01:32:13,581 --> 01:32:15,287
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1116
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,250
Mr. Baydir!

1117
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,010
When he first came to the sofa,

1118
01:32:47,068 --> 01:32:48,700
You brought a chest of gold.

1119
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,070
Hey, sir.

1120
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,630
I brought a chest of gold when he sold it.

1121
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:05,010
bring it.

1122
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:34,960
These,

1123
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:39,790
From the conquest of Marmaracik
your share of the spoils.

1124
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,300
Be there, sir.

1125
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,500
In this pusat,

1126
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,570
It's a gift from me to you.

1127
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,370
be there.

1128
01:34:44,924 --> 01:34:46,264
Be there, sir.

1129
01:34:47,513 --> 01:34:49,349
Whenever you will conquer,

1130
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,500
I'll come already.

1131
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,220
I will come anytime.

1132
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:57,980
Be there, sir.

1133
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:20,150
Now it's time for Marmaracik
to explain the judge.

1134
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,680
You all fought hard.

1135
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,182
You have irrigated the whole country with your blood and sweat.

1136
01:35:37,202 --> 01:35:38,784
You may exist.

1137
01:35:42,989 --> 01:35:43,749
But...

1138
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:48,460
who pays the greatest price,

1139
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,980
He will manage Marmaracık.

1140
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,630
Of course, price isn't everything.

1141
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,510
But on a bad day,

1142
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,510
the essence of man is revealed.

1143
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:13,800
I see now.

1144
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,759
You're all wondering what to say.

1145
01:36:19,464 --> 01:36:20,590
The name that will come out of my mouth,

1146
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,550
it won't change anything for you.

1147
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,230
that we are together,

1148
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,910
only our banner
for us to move forward.

1149
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,890
Because of this,

1150
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,199
The ruler of Marmaracik...

1151
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,480
Öktem Bey.

1152
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:10,960
Goodbye, sir.

1153
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,710
Since,

1154
01:37:14,712 --> 01:37:17,830
You have deemed me worthy of this sacred duty,

1155
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,640
your trust is my legacy.

1156
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,750
be there.

1157
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:36,370
Games were built on it.

1158
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,240
for your honour.

1159
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,340
thrown on your name
You took a cue for the stain.

1160
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,030
But...

1161
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,750
yet you listened to the word of the brain.

1162
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,980
Because of your stance

1163
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:52,370
Marmaracik is your right.

1164
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,620
I have an objection.

1165
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,590
There is news from Bayındır Bey.

1166
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:35,560
Like this.

1167
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,740
Tell me, I said.

1168
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:46,350
Mr. Osman,

1169
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,620
We learned his new move.

1170
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,740
He will attack Köprühisar.

1171
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,370
You were right.

1172
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:10,910
Osman does not stop.

1173
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:14,020
But now we know his move.

1174
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,150
Let's destroy it while we have it, Olof.

1175
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:18,970
We will.

1176
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,600
But first we have a job.

1177
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:25,800
We're going to get Remus.

1178
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:47,290
Mr. Osman!

1179
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,500
In many conquests with you,

1180
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:53,920
We gave many martyrs,

1181
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:55,440
together.

1182
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:58,070
Is Sade Öktem Bey lost?

1183
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:07,520
You know me in your heart, Osman Bey.

1184
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:12,200
I sacrificed everything for you.

1185
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:13,610
Obama,

1186
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:16,710
my alps, my lady.

1187
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,280
If there is more, I will do it.

1188
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,550
So it's not the throne, that's my point.

1189
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:30,290
Not that...

1190
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:35,860
The property that will be the headquarters in the conquest,

1191
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,759
he conquered,

1192
01:40:39,804 --> 01:40:42,080
bloodshed,

1193
01:40:43,451 --> 01:40:45,050
It is the right of someone who has given blood.

1194
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,270
for gas tomorrow,

1195
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:51,229
with which face our valiants
We will call you, Osman Bey?

1196
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,460
We will make new conquests, Turgut Bey.

1197
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:03,300
Is it property effort?
that keeps us together

1198
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,580
leave when there is no property.

1199
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,830
Mr. Oktem,

1200
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:17,630
His nephew Batur was martyred for Marmaracık.

1201
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,950
without even experiencing the pain
was slandered.

1202
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:28,960
Because of this,

1203
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,790
because of his pain,

1204
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,240
Marmaracik is his right.

1205
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,830
The other sofa is finished.

1206
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,580
Get the horses ready, Kutan.

1207
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:42,840
It's your command, sir.

1208
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,630
Mr. Turgut!

1209
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:13,950
Oh, Mr. Turgut!

1210
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,550
You chased us around,
From Marmaracik but...

1211
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,230
What has the throne benefited us,

1212
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,849
not you.

1213
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:25,630
What an empty talk, you waste your breath,

1214
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:26,690
Mr. Bayindir?

1215
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:28,745
Are you chasing fitness?

1216
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,070
Is the throne our concern?

1217
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:34,960
Since it is not the throne,

1218
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,250
what's up with this face?

1219
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,270
Osman Bey,

1220
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,950
Öktem considered the task appropriate.

1221
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,970
It's up to us to say, may God bless you.

1222
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,070
Is not it?

1223
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,260
What will fall on me

1224
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,560
don't worry, Mr. Bayindir.

1225
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,470
If you say more,

1226
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,580
I wouldn't say we are in the mansion of Mr.

1227
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:03,914
get the news.

1228
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:08,660
You teach right.

1229
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,890
We are in the mansion of Mr.

1230
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:14,159
If I mess with you now,

1231
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,090
Mr. Bayindir,

1232
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:21,000
He could not remove the task given to Mr. Öktem,

1233
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:23,180
He made a grudge, they say.

1234
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:26,089
Oh patience!

1235
01:44:26,656 --> 01:44:27,930
Oh, patience.

1236
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:28,990
Patience.

1237
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:32,200
Stay well.

1238
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,070
Oh patience!

1239
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:43,590
Oh patience!

1240
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,318
Come on Kutan, where are you?

1241
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,030
Oh Alflower!

1242
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,560
Do you come from oba or from physic?

1243
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:02,220
come on,
I know what I will do to you.

1244
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:10,602
Good luck, sir.

1245
01:45:10,622 --> 01:45:12,127
Thank you, thank you.
Thanks.

1246
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,620
be present.

1247
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:22,580
Sir!

1248
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:24,600
girl!

1249
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,060
Good news, I hope.

1250
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,850
No, it is no.

1251
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:34,730
You were so angry, you did,
Osman Bey, but...

1252
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,520
Osman Bey became his principal again.

1253
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,740
Marmaracik,

1254
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,590
deserved us.

1255
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,349
Informal Marmaracik is ours, babe.

1256
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,340
Oh my god!

1257
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,380
Will he find better than you?

1258
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:02,620
Even though Osman is late,
He found a man to lean on.

1259
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:05,030
Thank you babe, thank you.

1260
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:08,990
But...

1261
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:12,900
are these our eyes
I think they want to paint.

1262
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,909
Why would they want to paint our eyes?

1263
01:46:15,135 --> 01:46:16,960
de and Max Inspirations we see

1264
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:22,450
Osman's nephew

1265
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:24,400
Aktemur...

1266
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,360
Say it, come on.

1267
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,010
of Alçiçek,

1268
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:42,840
chasing after my daughter.

1269
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,420
Subasi?

1270
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:08,220
Ya babe, I'm bad too
I thought you were learning something.

1271
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:11,920
That's good news, good.
Aktemur is a good boy.

1272
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,072
Good boy, good boy.

1273
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:16,165
If it will happen, let it be.

1274
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:17,857
Mr. Oktem!

1275
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:21,780
I say Aktemur is a good boy, girl.

1276
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:22,930
Also,

1277
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:26,320
Better than Osman Bey's nephew
Will we find a groom?

1278
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:32,770
er?

1279
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:35,320
Does our girl have a heart?

1280
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:19,910
If you had waited a little longer,

1281
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:22,550
I was going to stand on the ground like that tree, Subasi.

1282
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,080
With the girl who doesn't have a heart in me,

1283
01:48:25,085 --> 01:48:26,450
Shall I come running to talk?

1284
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:30,746
Since you were so reluctant,

1285
01:48:31,006 --> 01:48:31,757
if you hadn't come.

1286
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,010
What did you come for?

1287
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:38,019
Oh patience!

1288
01:48:39,639 --> 01:48:41,742
Oh patience, Alçiçek Hatun!

1289
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:46,530
You called, you said it was important.

1290
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,673
But obviously, what you did first
words are not enough

1291
01:48:51,803 --> 01:48:54,910
Let me call this Aktemur,
You said let me share some more.

1292
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:57,900
It comes, after all.

1293
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:00,263
Have a heart!

1294
01:49:01,572 --> 01:49:02,490
It will come again.

1295
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:05,720
No,

1296
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:07,020
not like that.

1297
01:49:07,025 --> 01:49:07,799
Now--

1298
01:49:07,857 --> 01:49:10,110
What's wrong, Alçiçek Hatun, what's wrong?

1299
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:13,830
OK.

1300
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,770
I don't have a heart.

1301
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,510
OK, I'm not going to show up.

1302
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:24,320
But don't do that.

1303
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:28,920
My wound is very fresh.

1304
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:31,260
It bleeds again every time you look at it,

1305
01:49:31,265 --> 01:49:32,130
don't you see

1306
01:49:35,222 --> 01:49:36,690
Don't look like that, I'll be a victim.

1307
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,760
What do you want me to do, I don't understand.

1308
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:42,120
What do I do?

1309
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:44,010
Should I go from Yenişehir?

1310
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:46,140
I can not go.

1311
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,050
I have a duty.

1312
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,145
I call him too.

1313
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:53,740
You have a duty.

1314
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:56,920
You have a duty, you have a mother.

1315
01:49:57,490 --> 01:49:58,760
I have my mother.

1316
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,230
Out of all that...

1317
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,679
You play games with me, Alçiçek.

1318
01:50:10,371 --> 01:50:11,680
I'm not going to allow this.

1319
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,910
Aktemur!

1320
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,570
Actemur?

1321
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:58,310
Do you mean my name?

1322
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:01,610
Do I hear right?

1323
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,343
I couldn't throw off the earrings.

1324
01:51:05,323 --> 01:51:07,180
But I couldn't put it in my ear either.

1325
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:12,990
I've been running around in my belt like that.

1326
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:17,110
What does this mean?

1327
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,000
Don't squint your eyes.

1328
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:28,369
You shot me with them.

1329
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:31,221
Don't withhold.

1330
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:35,869
You have a heart too, huh?

1331
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,290
Does that mean that?

1332
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:50,220
There is, your eyes say.

1333
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:54,590
I can also hear from your voice, heh.

1334
01:52:01,738 --> 01:52:03,519
What will change if I say I have a heart?

1335
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,690
Once I said no,
the man who abandoned his love,

1336
01:52:09,148 --> 01:52:11,012
How will he make this difficult road?

1337
01:52:31,861 --> 01:52:33,070
I did not appear in your eyes,

1338
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,280
Because I didn't see your face

1339
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:37,740
Do you think I gave up?

1340
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,648
Isn't love mine?

1341
01:52:40,723 --> 01:52:44,050
Even if it's not you, even if you don't have a heart,

1342
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,040
my love with me.

1343
01:52:47,365 --> 01:52:48,030
with me

1344
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:50,729
Even if my soul goes out

1345
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,239
Even if my heart is soil, it is with me.

1346
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:00,200
But...

1347
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:04,300
You also have a heart.

1348
01:53:05,088 --> 01:53:06,030
This love

1349
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,030
it is a blessing of heaven, Alçiçek Hatun.

1350
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,038
You have a heart

1351
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:15,170
is not it?

1352
01:53:19,410 --> 01:53:20,565
There is.

1353
01:53:24,834 --> 01:53:26,190
I have a heart, Aktemur.

1354
01:53:25,495 --> 01:53:25,940
Did it work?

1355
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,990
But this road is very rough.

1356
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:34,739
You left with a word.

1357
01:53:35,093 --> 01:53:38,660
On this difficult road,
How will you deal with my mother?

1358
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:41,189
None of them is more difficult than being without you.

1359
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,999
I'll deal with it all, me.

1360
01:53:43,803 --> 01:53:45,190
Even now I think of my mother.

1361
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,160
If he sees us like this now,
do you know what happens?

1362
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,605
Blood comes out.

1363
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:54,969
Even if we get together

1364
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:57,070
this wouldn't let us go.

1365
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,590
We would be unhappy, Aktemur.

1366
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,680
Once you pattern,

1367
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,000
my name.

1368
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:10,010
Pattern one more time!

1369
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,010
We will be unhappy, I say.
What do you think?

1370
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,580
We are also unhappy separately, Alçiçek Hatun.

1371
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,469
Since both kinds
we will be unhappy

1372
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,810
which I think...

1373
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:39,110
we will be happy together.

1374
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:40,910
But...

1375
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,720
if you say so,

1376
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:45,000
Why should we be unhappy separately?

1377
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,250
Together,

1378
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:48,960
together...

1379
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:53,200
How is it going to be?

1380
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,050
Robust,

1381
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,420
open the map.

1382
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:22,099
Sir, from Kartal Yuvası to Köprühisar,

1383
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:23,782
to arrive,

1384
01:55:23,893 --> 01:55:25,370
This is the most secret way.

1385
01:55:27,489 --> 01:55:28,880
Is Cerkutay there too?

1386
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:31,170
It's there as you ordered, sir.

1387
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:33,750
Not just headquarters,

1388
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,940
Also to Bilecik and Karacahisar
secret ways must be found.

1389
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,030
But most importantly, Inegol.

1390
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:42,990
You should come from İnegöl without being seen.

1391
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:45,530
Turgut Bey also said,

1392
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,670
He would instruct his alps to besiege.

1393
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:50,089
In fact, he still has our catapults.

1394
01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:52,500
Where is Turgut Bey?

1395
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:53,870
Hasn't it come yet?

1396
01:55:57,348 --> 01:55:58,710
We haven't heard from yet, sir.

1397
01:56:02,190 --> 01:56:04,000
Even though he knew we were going to explore.

1398
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,980
or it's late

1399
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:15,690
or it hasn't even set out yet.

1400
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:21,520
We set off.

1401
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:24,100
He who looks behind cannot see ahead.

1402
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,020
Lets.

1403
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,659
Now we continue the exploration.

1404
01:56:27,665 --> 01:56:28,740
You continue to explore.

1405
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:54,250
Is there a destur, sir?

1406
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:58,210
Come on, Kutan.

1407
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,550
Mr. Osman,

1408
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:11,728
Conquest of Köprühisar with the Alps
explored for.

1409
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,940
The Alps await orders, too.

1410
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:17,194
Aren't we going, sir?

1411
01:57:22,241 --> 01:57:24,090
Osman Bey didn't need us, Kutan.

1412
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:31,720
Alhamdulillah, we are people of gas.

1413
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:35,800
But we are always on the side of truth.

1414
01:57:35,105 --> 01:57:35,840
we are in favor

1415
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:39,610
Now I see that

1416
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:41,810
Mr. Osman,

1417
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:44,260
He did not give the right to those who deserve it.

1418
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:48,320
Back to back for years
the wardens he fought,

1419
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:49,630
he didn't see.

1420
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,920
In short, our value was not known, Kutan.

1421
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:00,721
We also do not know our worth,

1422
01:58:02,202 --> 01:58:04,143
We make up for it by our absence.

1423
01:58:06,572 --> 01:58:08,010
So what are we going to do, sir?

1424
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:10,090
Are we going to stand back from Cenk?

1425
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,070
Don't you know Turgut Bey?

1426
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,220
Just because we are not behind Osman Bey,

1427
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:21,370
Are we going to back off from the gas?

1428
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,790
This is the world

1429
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:25,579
his neck is full of swear words.

1430
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,690
You always have the Alps ready, Kutan.

1431
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,980
We will certainly keep going.

1432
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:34,160
It's your command, sir.

1433
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:41,560
Ha Osman Bey,

1434
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:45,011
without it.

1435
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:33,209
Olof!

1436
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:41,550
Remus, the Emperor's loyal commander!

1437
01:59:53,852 --> 01:59:54,455
olof.

1438
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:05,800
The plays you translated with Kantakouzenos...

1439
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,270
It's all out now.

1440
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:10,490
Nothing is over yet.

1441
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:19,870
Mr. Osman,

1442
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,059
He will make Kantakouzenos talk.

1443
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:26,980
The Emperor will learn everything.

1444
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,048
And you...

1445
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:36,650
Cantacuzenos,

1446
02:00:37,490 --> 02:00:38,909
We must save him.

1447
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:41,580
Olof will also finish Osman's work.

1448
02:00:59,340 --> 02:00:59,990
Mother!

1449
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:03,540
So girl, where are you?

1450
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:04,790
If you hadn't come.

1451
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:06,860
Well, your tent is not done, mother.

1452
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:07,940
I just got out.

1453
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,235
Come on, you rest, I'll take care of the counter.

1454
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,260
what do you have?

1455
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,120
What is this joy?

1456
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:19,390
No.

1457
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,450
What will it be, mother?

1458
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:23,850
I heard about my father's mission.

1459
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:26,310
Why are you surprised?

1460
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:30,020
Would they find better than your father,
for that task?

1461
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:43,650
Come on, don't distract me, I have work.

1462
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:19,390
Ulgen Hatun.

1463
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:21,140
I am Aktemur Bey.

1464
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:24,450
What happens?

1465
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:30,500
Come on, tell me.
What's going on, I saw you.

1466
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,280
You were staring and staring.

1467
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:38,370
Alçiçek has a heart for me too.

1468
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:40,010
What did you say, sir, what did you say?

1469
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,060
Destur!

1470
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,339
Valide Ismihan Sultan!

1471
02:04:20,942 --> 02:04:22,300
They did not inform.

1472
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:24,500
This arrival, you say no?

1473
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,780
I don't know, Bala.

1474
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:29,530
But after the conquest...

1475
02:04:31,110 --> 02:04:32,060
Anyways.

1476
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:34,190
Let's say no, let's say no.

1477
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,840
Come on, come on.
Quick!

1478
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:42,360
Welcome, Ismihan Hatun.

1479
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:44,890
You are welcome.

1480
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:49,608
Osman Bey's ladies,
Malhun Hatun and Bala Hatun.

1481
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:26,380
Where is Osman Bey?

1482
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,090
to welcome us
He didn't bother, I guess.

1483
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:31,630
Estagfurullah.

1484
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:33,760
Osman Bey does not exist.

1485
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:36,220
Had he known of your arrival,

1486
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:39,340
He would have given you a worthy welcome, of course.

1487
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:48,970
You came from the road, you are tired.

1488
02:07:49,005 --> 02:07:50,250
Let's get you to your room.

1489
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:52,510
We did not come here to rest, Malhun Hatun.

1490
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:55,030
Government jobs don't wait.

1491
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,960
Of course it won't wait, Ismihan Hatun.

1492
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,680
But in case the state does not wait for the job,

1493
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,830
Osman Bey does not wait in the mansion.

1494
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:10,080
It constantly adds new ones to its lands.

1495
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:12,840
That's what I came for.

1496
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:19,860
Osman Bey, while running from battle to battle,

1497
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:22,110
your eye,

1498
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:23,320
covered with fog.

1499
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:29,026
where are you running to,

1500
02:08:30,137 --> 02:08:33,150
He couldn't see what he was destroying.

1501
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:36,890
Someone has to stop him.

1502
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:43,420
Now let's get to our main issue.

1503
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:48,330
Where is Kantakouzenos?

1504
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:02,800
Robust!

1505
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,730
Just what they said
we saw it with our own eyes.

1506
02:09:06,690 --> 02:09:08,090
Köprühisar is well preserved.

1507
02:09:09,090 --> 02:09:13,280
But the obstacle that will intimidate the Turk,
has not yet been established.

1508
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:15,000
Evalallah, sir.

1509
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,610
Get over your sentence,

1510
02:09:17,790 --> 02:09:20,629
We will wave our banner.

1511
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:25,360
Our work here is done.

1512
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:26,880
Come on, Alps!

1513
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:28,780
We will go to Yenişehir.

1514
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,300
You exit.

1515
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:13,180
who do not know the meaning of being a state,

1516
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:16,200
he does not know his limits.

1517
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:20,670
Where has he been seen, your great prince
that he is under arrest.

1518
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:25,470
You are right.

1519
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:30,780
With someone who thinks like this in this land
speaking, I was quite surprised.

1520
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,950
Since I came
the hand I always extend as a friend,

1521
02:10:35,013 --> 02:10:36,557
I saw hostility.

1522
02:10:37,045 --> 02:10:38,040
Those times have passed,

1523
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,400
cantacuzenos

1524
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:43,390
Who are you, what do you want from me?

1525
02:10:45,330 --> 02:10:49,250
Al-i, Sultan of Seljuks,
Alaeddin's mother

1526
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:51,700
I am Ismihan Sultan.

1527
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:57,740
You too, heir to the Byzantine throne,
Give Kantakouzenos.

1528
02:10:59,730 --> 02:11:01,380
The name of Al-i Seljuk

1529
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:03,710
reaches beyond its borders.

1530
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:08,110
We have been acquainted with Byzantium for a long time.

1531
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:11,490
We know each other very well.

1532
02:11:10,755 --> 02:11:11,440
we know.

1533
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,540
The time has come, we have made peace.

1534
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:18,460
The time has come, we fought.

1535
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,580
Now is the time

1536
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:23,910
It's deal time.

1537
02:11:27,430 --> 02:11:28,630
two states,

1538
02:11:29,230 --> 02:11:33,020
like Osman,
to the glory of the ignorant,

1539
02:11:33,330 --> 02:11:34,890
shouldn't be allowed.

1540
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:38,290
Byzantine and Seljuk wars,

1541
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:40,970
it was most beneficial for gentlemen like Osman.

1542
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:44,600
As we got weaker, they got stronger.

1543
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:46,100
Me,

1544
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:50,480
imprison a Byzantine prince
they dared.

1545
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,380
Let's give them the limit so that

1546
02:11:55,190 --> 02:11:56,090
Let's get stronger.

1547
02:11:57,650 --> 02:11:58,830
We will agree,

1548
02:11:59,020 --> 02:11:59,770
cantacuzenos

1549
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:01,470
We will agree.

1550
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:05,650
Now I have to get you out of here.

1551
02:12:07,210 --> 02:12:09,040
You're no use to me when I'm holding.

1552
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:15,790
This was not good at all.

1553
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:17,800
What will we do now?

1554
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,560
I don't know, Bala.

1555
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:23,590
But at a time like this,
We cannot contradict Ismihan Sultan.

1556
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:48,390
Wait, where would you take it?

1557
02:14:20,376 --> 02:14:22,910
before you,
then the one holding the rope...

1558
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:25,370
As long as you come to my land,

1559
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,660
This will be the fate of all of you.

1560
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:41,900
Cantacuzenos,

1561
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:44,410
is free.

1562
02:14:47,090 --> 02:14:49,800
While Osman Bey was gone,
We cannot allow such a thing.

1563
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:51,450
What you are saying is not correct.

1564
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:53,520
Right and wrong to you
I'm not going to ask, honey.

1565
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:57,580
take it away.

1566
02:14:57,980 --> 02:14:59,620
what you have given me,

1567
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:03,350
especially your hospitality.
I will never forget.

1568
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:05,970
until we meet again,

1569
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:08,050
enjoy life.

1570
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:41,650
Go to Tez Olof.

1571
02:15:42,430 --> 02:15:45,860
free of Kantakouzenos
You say you left.

1572
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:12,640
Boran, bring Kantakouzenos to the sofa.

1573
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:14,020
Storm!

1574
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:16,030
Sir!

1575
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,370
Kantakouzenos is not in the dungeon.

1576
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:21,550
They released.

1577
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:23,810
What do you say, Bala?

1578
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,550
Who did this?

1579
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:38,412
Who did?

1580
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:08,397
Who released my prisoner?

1581
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:28,030
Sultan of Konya, mother of Alaeddin,

1582
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:30,140
Ismihan Sultan.

1583
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:34,220
whoever you are

1584
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:38,930
captive, my captive.

1585
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:41,130
The city is my city.

1586
02:17:47,850 --> 02:17:49,827
Here, only my rule applies.

1587
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:09,674
The one who lurks on my property,

1588
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:11,770
I will rip your heart out.

1589
02:18:14,030 --> 02:18:15,200
Mr. Osman!

1590
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:18,000
Know your limits.

1591
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:31,260
Sultan of Konya,

1592
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:35,220
as long as it's there
everything that is yours

1593
02:18:35,570 --> 02:18:36,490
it is ours.

1594
02:18:42,129 --> 02:18:43,482
If we pulled a coin,

1595
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:45,814
It means we are on our property.

1596
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,950
Do not even think about it!

1597
02:18:49,747 --> 02:18:50,652
Do not.

1598
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:57,208
to reach out for what's mine
Don't get up, Ismihan Hatun.

1599
02:18:58,970 --> 02:18:59,990
Mr. Osman!

1600
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:03,760
If you are Uc Bey,
You will bow to me.

1601
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:10,070
No, if you say I am the state,

1602
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:16,210
what is behind the sentence oba
will be taken away.

1603
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:20,700
I said, 'Don't give me a hand.

1604
02:19:22,270 --> 02:19:24,170
You covet my obama,

1605
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:26,270
girl!

1606
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:29,520
He cuts the outstretched hand,

1607
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:31,850
I'll cut out that eye.

1608
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,530
Everyone will know.

1609
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,690
I'll let you know if you don't know.

1610
02:19:53,597 --> 02:19:54,700
Here,

1611
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:57,670
Mister is me too

1612
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:00,180
The state is mine!
